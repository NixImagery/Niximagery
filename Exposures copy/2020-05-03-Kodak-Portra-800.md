Colour negative film, cost £12.50 per roll from Analog Wonderland. Loaded 28th April 2020, finished 12 July. Sent to [AG Photolab](https://www.ag-photolab.co.uk/) for processing: £3.49 plus £3.49 P&P. About 54p per image.

Problems with light flares on most of the 36 exposures. AG were very helpful and suggested these were light leaks in the camera - I'm going to put it in for a proper clean, lube, adjust and to have the light seals replaced. The Fuji GW690ii also, and probably my old Nikon FM body. The best camera I have at the moment (film) is the fifteen-quid Afga. That leaks too, sometimes, but it often takes excellent photos.

I also think that when everything works (i.e. the camera, the operator), this film stock works really well, even if at the moment most of what I am taking is pretty dull stuff.
