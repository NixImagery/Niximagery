<h3>Film exposure list</h3>
<p>These pages contain listings of the exposures taken in each roll of film, with details of the camera and exposure settings for each frame, where I noted it at the time. It's really just my reference. Not all of these were scanned, and most of them aren't on this site. Ask if you're particularly interested.</p>
<ul>
  {% for exposure in site.exposures %}
    <li><small>{{ exposure.date | date: "%B %Y" }}</small> | <a class="tag-link" href="{{ exposure.url }}">{{ exposure.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endif %}
