My name is Nick Hood. Jack of All, Master of None and perpetually frustrated by that. I have had the privilege of enjoying travel and adventure in my various careers, and have picked up more tricks than scars on the way. Born with a fast brain and a slightly faster mouth, I have on occasion had to move on but always, I hope, with sense of humour intact.

### Photography
This site is a place where I can expand on the quick-and-dirty posting of images that I do in social channels and on my [photo website](https://photo.cullaloe.net). There are often stories to go with the pictures and I wanted to try to make a space where I can, if I can find the time, tell the stories of the images. Or maybe post the images of the stories. Whatever. I hope you enjoy it - thanks for stopping by - and please post comments or questions if you like.

The header photo was taken by my wife. She is [a better photographer than I am](https://karamudie.co.uk/).
