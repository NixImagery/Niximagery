There's nothing like a walk on a beach, especially when it's one of the long, windy, sea-birdy beaches like you find along the coast near Dunbar. We took ourselves off to Belhaven beach for such a walk, to clear the head, and to reset our fish supper metrics after a bad experience at Ballachulish.

I'm finding myself using a mix of digital and film cameras when I'm out. When I need to shoot quickly, it's more likely that I'll grab the Ricoh in my pocket, like when I noticed a figure walking across the scene before us:
