This is the first roll of my own film I have put through this little Agfa. My wife and I went out during the so-called lockdown for some messages and a little exercise, having heard on the news that it's OK to get in your car and take a short drive to somewhere local if it helps you remain socially distanced enough to fight the spread of COVID-19. We decided that a walk on a beach would be safer and more responsible than a walk in the local park.

## Stupid is as stupid does
I'm still not quite myself following a recent loss, but I make no excuses for myself: these are the first four exposures on this film in the camera:

Notice that these were all carefully exposed without remembering to advance the film. I re-took the building on frame 2 using the same settings.

I did it again on frame 4, re-taking the shots in 5 and 6. Apparently, photography is good for mindfulness.

## Summary of the results
I notice that I didn't deviate from 1/200s shutter speed with this roll. It was quite bright and so perhaps 400 ISO wasn't right for the conditions, given that this camera's shutter doesn't go any faster than that. Even inside the Monk's cave, I was exposing for the surfaces lit directly from the outside.

## Next steps
