Kodak Professional Ektachrome E100 is a new, fine grained colour transparency film perfectly suited to bright spring sunshine and the countryside. In good light, I have always favoured Kodak transparency film for colour saturation, so this first time out for me with Kodak's new T-grain modern slide film was a good exercise.

## Soaking up the sunshine at Pattiesmuir

The April sun was splitting the sky, so we went out around Pattiesmuir, a local walking route which winds through rural pathways and copses, offering glimpses of the iconinc Forth bridges.

My wife and I have been going out with cameras for a number of years, both of us using Fuji X-series digital cameras usually. Recently, though, I have left the digital behind, and carried only a film camera. The more careful selections I am making is, I think, good for my photography because it slows me down and makes me think more carefully about framing, intent and especially the light. As a result, I do not take as many frames as I would with a digital camera in my hands. I find it hard to finish a roll of 36 in one go, and today was no exception. 

## Norton Common

I next picked up the camera when, on another sunny day, we took ourselves on a bitter-sweet reflective walk on Norton Common. Earlier that day, we had said goodbye to my beloved Mum and it felt right to take ourselves to this special place in my old hometown. We found deer, and squirrels, sunbeams and forget-me-nots there, all of which seemed to be speaking to us in some way that was comforting.


## Rosyth

The remaining half dozen frames were made in short exercise trips out the back door during the continuing COVID-19 restrictions.

## The camera

The camera I used today was an eBay-sourced Nikon FM of similar vintage to my old FM, whose shutter was sadly condemned last year. It feels very similar but different, not least because the focusing screen is quite mucky, which reminds me every time I frame a shot that this is a substitute for my *real* Nikon FM. I am loving the lens, however, which is the superb AI-s 28mm f/2.8 which gives excellent results across a range of apertures.

## Summary of the results
Most of the landscape shots were around f/16, 1/125th of a second exposure, consistent with the Kodak data sheet where there are distinct shadows.

### Notes

All of these images were taken on a Nikon FM with the Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8 lens. These frames were shot on a single 36 exposure roll of Kodak Ektachrome E100.
