During our recent short vacation to Corfu, we took no "proper" cameras to ensure we got the downtime we both so sorely needed. Although there were plenty of photo opportunities, we did well to resist the temptation to reach for the phone and grab a gratuitous snap for the most part, anyway. The old town is too much of a temptation, however, so here are a few photos taken on my iPhone to share the experience of the excursion into Corfu Town.

The old town has a long history, dating back to the 8th century BC. It is a [UNESCO World Heritage Centre](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/978/). Walking the streets and narrow alleyways gives the feeling of many cultures: from the influence of the centuries of Venetian rule to the footsteps of those who have passed this way before.

The town is also known as *Korkyra* and features two major fortresses, the "old" and "new". We climbed to the New Fortress above the town and paid a few Euro to walk around it. New, it is not, dating back to the 16th century, a couple of hundred years after the "old" Fortress.

The holiday continued once we returned home, smug as we were that it had rained the whole time we were away, only to get quite warm once we got back. This is not a picture of Corfu, but of our first breakfast at home. It's good to be home again, with the warmth of the Corfu sunshine still in our skin.
