# Lower Largo

We took a weekend run up the coast to Crail and the Kilminning nature reserve, and we played on the beach at Lower Largo. I used up my last roll of Acros in my GW690ii rangefinder -- I thought it was polite to put Fuji in Fuji.

**The Forth Estuary** Acros II

The estuary is wide at this point, and the North Sea lies beyond to the East. Oil rigs work the natural resources. Shipping passes and wildlife abounds as the waves are expressive and sincere in their tidal cadence. The people love the beaches, where cares are blown away and life slows to reveal its meaning.

**Half Moon** Acros II

I developed the Acros film at home in Rodinal R09 for an hour, turning once half-way, which I regret. The highlights might have been less bright if I hadn't, and retained more detail.
