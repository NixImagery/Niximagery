Inside each of us there’s a continual autumn.  
Our leaves fall and are blown out over the water,  
a crow sits in the blackened limbs and talks about what’s gone.  
There’s a necessary dying, and then we are reborn breathing again.

Very little grows on jagged rock.  
Be ground.  
Be crumbled  
so wildflowers will come up where you are.

-- Jalal Al-din Muhammad Rumi
