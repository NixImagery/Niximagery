**C**abinet-maker, could you craft me a conker? 

**O**il its wood, burnish its veneer, set it glowing from within?

**N**ever. Not a chance. No hope at all.

**K**ing, then, could you command me a conker? Compel its green spikes to grow, its white plush to thicken? Impossible. Impractical. Inconceivable.

**E**ngineer, surely you could design me a conker? Refine its form, mill its curves and edges? Manufacture me that magic casket? Unfeasible. Unworkable. Unimaginable.

**R**ealize this (said the Cabinet-maker, the King and the Engineer together), conker cannot be made, however you ask it, whatever word or tool you use, regardless of decree. Only one thing can conjure conker â€“ and that thing is tree.
