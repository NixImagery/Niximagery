# Potsdam in a GW690ii

**Beach**

Lomography Potsdam 100 8 exp Â£8 per roll in camera with a yellow filter in Fife 7 - 27 Jun 2020. Semi-stand developed in Rodinal. Scanned on an Epson Perfection V600.

Results were a bit disappointing again but I'm not convinced that the film is at fault - I really like this contrasty cinematic film and might try it again.
