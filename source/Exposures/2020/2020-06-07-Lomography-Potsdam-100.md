# Potsdam in an Isolette 120
![](/img/2020-04-17-Kodak-TMY-12.jpg)

Black and white negative film, cost Â£8.00 per roll from Analog Wonderland. Exposed between 4 - 7 Jun 2020 in and around Barkway, Hertfordshire. 

I processed this film at home, intending to semi-stand develop in Rodinal R09 one shot, which would have worked out at something like 75p per shot. However, I made a stupid mistake, and reached for the stop solution instead of the developer, resulting in completely blank (transparent) carrier at the end (not even the manufacturer's film markings along the side).
