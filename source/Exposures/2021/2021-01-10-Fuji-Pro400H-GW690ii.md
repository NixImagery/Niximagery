I shot this roll on a winter walk up at the Hermitage in late 2020 but didn't have it developed until early 2021. The exposed roll got "lost" in my disorganised kit bag. We got talking up at Pine Cone Point to a guy flying a drone there who was interested in the big Fuji camera I was toting. It is quite a camera, and seems to be performing well after some TLC, fixing the light leaks.

I'm learning that I'm not much of a fan of this film stock. I am tempted to touch the white balance more with this film than others. I find it has a blue quality that makes the images seems cold: perhaps it is an acquired taste.

The film was scanned on an Epson V600 at 6400 dpi, minimal adjustments (cropping and dynamic range) and rendering to jpg in Capture One Pro.
