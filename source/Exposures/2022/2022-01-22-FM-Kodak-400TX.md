# Nikon FM Kodak 400TX Tri-X

Waiting for development.

I loaded my Nikon FM 6506321 with a roll of Kodak Tri-X 400TX film in September 2021. The roll was exposed with the Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8 lens and a Tiffen Yellow filter #2. I stupidly forgot the camera had film in it, so I opened the back to check. Yes, *I opened the back of the camera to check if there was film in it*. This is why I can't have nice things.
