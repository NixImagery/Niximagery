# Niximagery

![](/img/Dunbar.jpg)

My name is Nick Hood. Jack of All, Master of None and perpetually frustrated by that. I have had the privilege of enjoying travel and adventure in my various careers, and have picked up more tricks than scars on the way. Born with a fast brain and a slightly faster mouth, I have on occasion had to move on but always, I hope, with sense of humour intact.

## This place

There are sometimes stories to go with pictures I make. I wanted to try to make a space where I can, if I can find the time, tell the stories of the images. Or maybe post the images of the stories. Whatever. This is one of those places, although I am increasingly eschewing the digital spaces I have (over)inhabited. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for stopping by.

p.s. the bridge photo? That was taken by my wife. She is [a better photographer than I am](https://wildaye.co.uk/).
