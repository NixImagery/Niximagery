# Niximagery, stories and images

!!! abstract "New scans, 14th August 22"
    I have scanned a few images from film recently developed and some not so recently, including the sunflowers from last year's trip to Ardross Farm and their [Field of Hope](https://www.facebook.com/fieldofhopesunflowermaze/). You can see the first of the scans from that roll [here](/Exposures/2022/2022-08-08-ektachrome-100/) and some images taken with the same camera on Lomography's Potsdam B&W film [here](/Exposures/2021/2021-11-01-Potsdam-100-503CW/). AG returned the scans of our trip to Split Rock Croft in February, captured on [35mm Portra 160 film](/Exposures/2022/2022-04-12-Portra-160-FM73/) this week, too. More in a couple of weeks, hopefully.

Honestly, I don't know how people find the time. Life is full of challenges and yet others seem to manage it. I am too busy: working, with daily stuff to do, a PhD project under way, keeping up with my reading, music, sketching and helping my wife with her garden projects.

**Time and tide wait for no man**

I have been prompted to pay more attention to this photo/stories/sketches website by a need to express ideas. I don't know what the psychology of it is, but as I get older, I feel the creative itch more than ever.

Not wanting to do it the easy way (any fool can snap an image on a phone nowadays), I have in the past couple of years been playing with film cameras and a bit of home processing. So has everyone else, apparently, and so prices have rocketed.

Anyway, I have renewed the photo mojo a bit in the late summer of 2022 and so have managed several things.

* I've found all of the exposed film laying about and either developed it myself, or sent the colour rolls to AG Photographic. There are several films to scan now, but I'll do that in the coming weeks.
* Archived my Flickr collection of over 10,000 images and reset the space to be more useful.
* Refreshed my 500px account and posted new content there
* The website is now migrated from the Jekyll site, which was nice but too slow-loading for my liking, to one built on  the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) Python framework. I took the opportunity to edit some of that content.
* A new story published this week about [a day trip up the East neuk](/Stories/2022/2022-08-07-east-neuk/) in which I just ran with the digital Fuji X-T2.

So, thanks for reading so far. I hope to try to keep this place a little more dynamic, so please pop back, comment or subscribe [^how].

## Niximagery

!!! quote "Ibarionex Perello"
    We look at things all the time, but we do not really see them.

## This place

There are sometimes stories to go with pictures I make. I wanted to try to make a space where I can, if I can find the time, tell the stories of the images. Or maybe post the images of the stories. Whatever. This is one of those places, although I am increasingly eschewing the digital spaces I have (over)inhabited. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it. 

Getting around is easy: click on pictures to see a gallery of the images on any page. On a desktop browser, click the `>` and `<` keys to navigate forward and backwards.

## Other places

I appreciate the power of social media but I hate gratutious and cynical commercial exploitation with a passion. I do keep a presence on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/niximagery/), more to browse the work of good artists than anything else. I hate what Mark Zuckerberg's lack of class has done to the platform and will likely very soon ditch it, as I have ditched Facebook pages, Twitter, Tumblr and the rest.

    [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/niximagery/) is a different case. The people behind that space have weathered the storm of fashion and survive on a hybrid free/subscription based model. The groups and forums on Flickr have been helpful to me so I pay the fee when I can afford it. I recently (July 2022) archived all of the content I had there and am building it up gently to a moderate presence.

Finally, [500px](https://500px.com/p/niximagery?view=photos) started well but were bought out by a Chinese media company. That killed it for many users, for whom there was a real sense of belonging, especially with the Global Photowalks that 500px got behind -- I am still friends with many of the people I met at [the 2015 London event](https://500px.com/search?q=500pxGPW15&type=photos&sort=pulse) -- but that has also been spoiled by the acquisition. I sustain a free account there, and have noticed a new interest from the people behind the platform in developing their community. They have recently increased the upload limit (to 21 images per week, plenty for me) so perhaps it will improve.

## About me

My name is Nick Hood. Jack of All, Master of None and perpetually frustrated by that. I have had the privilege of enjoying travel and adventure in my various careers, and have picked up more tricks than scars on the way. Born with a fast brain and a slightly faster mouth, I have on occasion had to move on but always, I hope, with sense of humour intact.

Thanks for stopping by.

p.s. the bridge photo? That was taken by my wife. She is [a better photographer than I am](https://wildaye.co.uk/).
