# Pattiesmuir and Portra

![](/img/R0000549.jpg)
*Pattiesmuir, Ricoh GRIII*

We took a walk down at Pattiesmuir again, because we can and we need to. I took my Nikon FM loaded with Kodak Portra 800 this time, and my little Ricoh GR III in my pocket. This gave me a picture to share on Instagram (above) when we got home - with a fresh 36-exposure roll of Portra, which I got developed later[^july].

This little place is a secret haven for photographers, it's so photogenic and variable with the seasons. The bluebells are coming, after the last frosts have become ancient history. The wild garlic is flowering, too, and the whole place, with its gnarled stumps and undergrowth on the hill, is magical.

*Still life* Portra 800, Nikon FM, AI-s 28mm f/2.8 

The film I started on this outing was pretty much wasted, as most of the shots had what I described as "flare". AG, the film processing business I use, were very helpful and suggested these were light leaks in the camera - I put the Nikon in for a proper clean, lube, adjust and had the light seals replaced. The Fuji GW690ii also, and my old Nikon FM body. 

I think that when everything works (i.e. the camera, the operator), this film stock works really well, even if at the moment most of what I am taking is pretty dull stuff.
