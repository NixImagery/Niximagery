# E100 in an Isolette
Sunday 4th October, 2020.

I took my little Agfa Isolette, loaded with Kodak Ektachrome E100 to nearby Kinghorn beach, a place my wife and I often go to for a bit of headspace and diversion from the rest of the world. 

## Sunny 16 will do

Despite the habits of the digital age, for this roll, I didn't record all the exposure details, going broadly with "sunny 16", occasionally referring to an app on my iPhone for aperture and shutter speed combinations that might be reasonable. It was a bright, partly sunny day, and I took some of the shots at 1/50 s hand-held, although some were at 1/200 s or between these two. Apertures were between f/8 and f/16, mostly. I finished the film and sent it to AG for developing with another E100 I had recently finished in my [Fuji GW690ii](/Stories/2020/2020-10-04-E100-gw690/).

## Scanning and pixel peeping

The transparencies were scanned in an Epson V600. At 6400 dpi, this yields a file around 750 MB in size, and an image approaching 250 megapixels, but this is not anything like equivalent to "better than a Fuji GFX" unless the camera and photographer have combined to capture the absolute highest quality image possible. I certainly am not consistently getting that kind of precision, even if the camera can, but it won't stop me trying. I scanned these at 3200 dpi for an image nearer 50 Megapixels in a file under 200MB after cropping.

**Near Kinghorn beach.** Adjusted for crop and wonky horizons in Iridient Developer. Size reduction for the web was in Apple's Preview.

It's not lost on me that a roll of this film, with processing, costs more than the camera did. I'm sure that's not a unique situation but given that the Agfa Isolette is a medium format camera, and the quality of the capture and rendering are, in my view, pretty good, then I am left wondering why I am also happy, from time to time, to launch a grand or more on a digital camera. Maybe those days are over.

The variation in exposures in this roll are certainly operator error. I do a lot of calculating while I shoot, having never developed any real "intuitive feel" for exposure over the years. There's time yet -- as Henri Cartier-Bresson says, "your first 10,000 photographs are your worst".

## Notes on exposures
