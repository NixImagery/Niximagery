# Dumglow
![](/img/DSF7743.jpg)
*Moss*

We took a walk up a local hill to clear our heads of work matters, get some exercise, and connect with nature and bigger things. It was exactly a year since my Mum had left this mortal coil and we had woken at the same time as we had a year ago when the call came. It seemed appropriate to be occupied with the world in a less worldly way, yet we packed ourselves a healthy lunch, boots and cameras.

*Loch Leven*

I took my digital Fuji X-T2 and a favourite 35mm f/2 lens for its versatility. There was a film camera in my backpack but I didn't think too much about photography, to be honest. It was nice to walk in the sunshine, through cool forest with the soft humus, springy beneath our feet and the birdsong all around us. As ever, it was windy near the top of Dumglow: the final climb up the forest path is accompanied by the sound of it.

Scotland. There's no place quite like it for your mental wellbeing.
