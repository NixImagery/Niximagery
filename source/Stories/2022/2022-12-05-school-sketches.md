# School sketches

During late November and early December, my job has required me to make visits to schools. The schedule can be challenging so I always try to arrive around 20 minutes early so as to check any messages, and enter the school with grace and dignity. On this cycle of visits, I thought I'd use the extra time to practice some sketching.

    *Linlithgow Academy*

There is a rationale for this habit. Sketching is a deliberate, mindful process, even when done quickly. I helps you see what is there, and the looking doesn't stop when the sketchbook is closed. At Linlithgow, I found myself studying wall displays, people, the dynamic of school reception spaces, looking at shapes and patterns as much as inscriptions. I even got the chance to assist some not-yet-detective material police officers in their hunt for the reception desk, being able to indicate the huge sign that my fine-tuned sketcher's observational skills had spotted in the lobby.

    *Deans Community High School*

We continue to invest in building new schools to replace older, more out of date infrastructure. This is a good thing for many reasons including sending a message to the country that education is important and valuable to us all. Whilst every school is different, design features and material choices appear in as many of the recent builds, perhaps dating them. This is not to say they look the same -- they do, in some respects, but each has its own features according to the perceived needs of the community they serve.

    *Kirkcaldy High School*

I taught Physics and Mathematics at Kirkcaldy High School for a number of years before replacing my own tutor at Moray House. I'm not going to reminisce about this old place but it was nice to go back for a visit and see friends and former colleagues again. I was reminded that cultures are slow to change and that whilst rolling stones may gather no moss, they do gather experience you don't get standing still.

    *Preston Lodge High School*

Bunsen burners, magnesium strips and good dialogic pedagogy made my job easy at Preston Lodge High School today. All the nicer to see more old friends, too. Education is a village, and once you've been at it a while, it can feel like going home when you meet again, people who have shared different parts of your journey. Conversations pick up where they left off, friendship hugs shock the pupils, and mutual respect is grown and shared from stories of careers unfolding. I love it when new teachers see that: they are enculturated into their vocation through the modelled behaviours of those that go before them, and shape them. There's more to this than Vygotksy, or Bruner, or the latest educational fad.

    *Portobello High School*

Preston Lodge and Portobello sketches are not the best likeness to the *real thing*, for similar reasons. At Preston Lodge, my view from the car was obscured by a large van and so I had to interpret and sketch what I *felt* was there. Isn't that the point, though? The American photographer David Alan Harvey said, "Don't shoot what it looks like. Shoot what it feels like." This is my motivation in photography as much as in sketching, and exploring that idea is the principal reason for me wanting to sketch more often. At Portobello, a different large van also obscured the view, and I don't have the confidence quite to stand in a car park sketching, in full view of the CCTV. I had a call to go in to school anyway, so I took a quick photo on my phone and sketched it up later in a café over lunch. From this experience, I think I do a better job sketching live, *en plein air*, than from a photo. Something seems to be missing in my drawing from a photo, at least where my skills are at present. Perhaps that will change with practice.

    *The lorry at Leith, with a fast rat*

Leith Academy has a nice front façade but you can't see it from where I parked, and the back of the building is ugly, so I sketched the random lorry in the car park instead. I did not find out what the vehicle does, or why it's there, but it looks arty to me, even if seems past its best service days. Leith has always felt like an arty school: it has interesting shaped science labs which are full of scope and character, even if some of the electrical infrastructure also seems past its best service days. The teachers are anything but, of course, nor the businesslike head teacher who introduced himself as I was preparing to leave for my next appointment. It's great that there are schools like Leith who put the effort and investment into new teachers, for the wider good of Scottish education.

    *Musselburgh Grammar School*

There is a *quid pro quo*, of course, in the benefit that mentors and other colleagues get from watching rookies make naïve mistakes and offering guidance and advice from experience, at the same time tapping in to new ideas and reconnecting to the principles of pedagogy that are fresh in the student teachers' thinking. This was articulated in both schools I visited today by the supporting teachers who played their important part in bringing about fair and just evaluation of how their charges have progressed.

 <!-- against the high standards of the General Teaching Council for Scotland. I am thankful that we have those -- both the standards and the Teaching Council. -->

<!-- I am learning that I see better when I look for the feeling. -->

More to come later this week.
