# School sketches

Over the past 6 weeks, my job has required me to make visits to schools. The schedule can be challenging so I always try to arrive around 20 minutes early so as to check any messages, and enter the school with grace and dignity. On this cycle of visits, I thought I'd use the extra time to practice some sketching.

There is a rationale for this habit. Sketching is a deliberate, mindful process, even when done quickly. I helps you see what is there, and the looking doesn't stop when the sketchbook is closed. I found myself studying wall displays, people, the dynamic of school reception spaces, looking at shapes and patterns as much as inscriptions. I even got the chance to assist some not-yet-detective material police officers in their hunt for the reception desk, being able to indicate the huge sign that my fine-tuned sketcher's observational skills had spotted in the lobby.

We continue to invest in building new schools to replace older, more out of date infrastructure. This is a good thing for many reasons including sending a message to the country that education is important and valuable to us all. Whilst every school is different, design features and material choices appear in as many of the recent builds, perhaps dating them. This is not to say they look the same -- they do, in some respects, but each has its own features according to the perceived needs of the community they serve.

*Kirkcaldy High School*

I taught Physics and Mathematics at Kirkcaldy High School for a number of years before replacing my own tutor at Moray House. I'm not going to reminisce about this old place but it was nice to see friends and former colleagues again. I was reminded that cultures are slow to change and that whilst rolling stones may gather no moss, they do gather experience you don't get standing still.

More will follow.
