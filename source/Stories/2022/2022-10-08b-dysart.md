# Dysart

!!! quote "Robert Bresson"
    Make visible, what without you, might perhaps never have been seen.

After lunch, we had an errand to run in the Lang Toun which gave us an excuse to take another walk, this time around the harbour at Dysart. There is a huge wall there which is home to various pigeons, and tells quite a story of how this place has changed over the years. Part of the cliff at the end of the harbour is no longer safe to walk along but it is easy to access the coastal walk through a short tunnel in the cliff at the end of the wall.

**A shed** by the harbour was eclectically decorated with harboury stuff, and really set the feel of the place.

We arrived at feeding time for the boats, and they seemed to think we had treats for them.

**The wall again**, because it is fascinating. The landscape of it seemed other-worldly.

Plenty of things to look at in a harbour. There were people working, moving boats, furling sails and so on, and just as many sitting on benches. There were benches everywhere we looked today and I think I like that. Perhaps we are becoming more reflective.
