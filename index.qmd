A lot has changed since your last visit, quite possibly. I think that the [Niximagery Substack](https://nximagery.substack.com) has not worked the way I had hoped, quite probably because I didn't pay it enough attention. It will likely disappear soon.

I eventually took the opportunity to join the [Edinburgh Urban Sketchers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Edinburghurbansketchers) for one of their regular sessions. I have been carrying sketching materials around with me for a couple of years now and only rarely find the nerve to actually take them out and use them. I think this event has broken the fear of drawing in public. I made a couple of sketches from St. Davids bay and another today on [a trip to St Monans](Stories/2024/02-16-st-monans.qmd). I'm not going to put all of my sketching efforts online, it sort of defeats the point of the practice.
