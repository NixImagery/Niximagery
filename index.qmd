There is new machinery behind the Niximagery website, based on the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) web publishing system I am using for other technical sites. I'm really liking that it just works. 
 
We took a little trip around the bypass yesterday to spend some time on a beach. What is it about the sound of the shoreline that touches us so deeply? Is it our marine ancestors, or something closer to home in our cultural resonances? This picture is from drone footage at Loch Shiel earlier this year and captures new perspective, yet old knowing as if from a dream or astral journey. Why are such visions so familiar to us?
