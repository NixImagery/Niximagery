# Lomography Berlin 400 120

In the camera from 12th - 14th July, with a yellow filter for the sky. Kino film, £9 per roll from Analog Wonderland.

I destroyed this film in development. I tried to "stand develop" it using Ilfosol 3 developer: this is a quick ("hot") developer, I later discovered, and thus the over-development that resulted (very faded images on the carrier) was not really a surprise in retrospect.

What I'm learning is that you can't "wing it" like that, and expect to keep your images.
