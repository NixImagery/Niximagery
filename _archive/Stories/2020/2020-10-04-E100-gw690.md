# Crail on E100 in a Fuji GW 690ii
Sunday 4th October, 2020.

A recent run up to Crail on a sunny weekend was all the excuse I needed to drop a roll of Kodak Ektachrome into my recently CLA-d Fuji GW690ii. We played with the waves crashing on the rocks for a while, and let the coastal breeze blow away the COVID cobwebs. I finished the film off on a run to Dunkeld. A week later, development is done and the transparencies returned from the excellent AG Photo Lab.

**Crail beach.** Some adjustment in Capture One (horizon).

At 320 dpi, these transparencies, scanned in an Epson V600 yield an image around 90 Megapixels in a file something over 250MB in size. The scanner can do more, but there's no advantage for most of my images at the moment. I notice that letting the scanner do dust removal or sharpening introduces digital artefacts. I know it's clever and all, but I hate it when machines do the thinking for you, without asking permission first. I guess the next step might be a move to direct printing, and to skip the digital completely. How will I share that with you? Maybe post a photograph.

## Notes

Colour positive (slide) film, cost £12.40 per roll from Analog Wonderland. To AG photographic for E-6 developing 20th September 2020 £14.49 for 2 rolls.
