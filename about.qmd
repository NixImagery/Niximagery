There are sometimes stories to go with pictures I make. I wanted to try to make a space where I can, if I can find the time, tell the stories of the images. Or maybe post the images of the stories. Whatever. [Niximagery.com](https://niximagery.com) is like a digital home that I return to from time to time but I also write over at [SubStack](https://circlesaroundthegrit.substack.com/). I hope you enjoy them both.

p.s. the doors photo? That was taken by my wife.  
She is [a better photographer than I am](https://wildaye.co.uk/).
