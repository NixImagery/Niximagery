I bought this incredible little camera on a whim for about Â£15 and found that it still had film in it from when it was last used. On developing the film, I estimate this to have been around 1980.

**The Isolette**

The camera is simple: there is nothing electronic here, just a folding box with an f/4.5 Agnar 85mm fixed lens. The film is advanced (if you remember) by winding a knob on the top of the camera body, and the lens shutter is cocked separately (if you remember). It does take a while to get used to, but the results are worth it -- big, 6cm x 6cm frames that at a 4800 dpi scan will yield beautiful 100 mega pixel digital images that have all the character of the film stock.
