6th March 2020 I bought, on a whim, a cheap Vintage Agfa Isolette I medium format camera from [gotanyose](https://www.ebay.com/usr/gotanyose) on eBay, for £18 including £4.50 p&p.

> "Agfa Isolette Camera in Superb Condition. Agfa Agnar 1:4.5/85 Lens. Comes with original Flash.” 

I found, on opening the back, that it still had a roll of Kodacolor II in it from when it was last used. On having the film developed[^ag], I estimate this to have been from around 1980. Here is one of the original images from that roll:

I finished the roll but clearly the film had suffered over time.

The camera itself is a second version Isolette I was produced between 1955 and 1958, according to [camera-wiki](http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Isolette#Isolette_I).

## The Isolette I

The Isolette is a simple device: there is nothing electronic here, just a folding box with an f/4.5 Agnar 85mm fixed lens and Vario shutter. The film is advanced (if you remember[^arse1]) by winding a knob on the top of the camera body, and the lens shutter is cocked separately (if you remember[^arse2]). It does take a while to get used to, but the results are worth it -- big, 6cm x 6cm frames that at a 4800 dpi scan will yield beautiful 100 mega pixel digital images that have all the character of the film stock.

I got the light seals replaced by [Cameratiks](https://www.cameratiks.co.uk/) in Edinburgh for a fiver. This has given me a wonderful, portable medium format film camera that takes brilliant images for under £25. This is a recent image of Yester Castle (another one is in the header of this post):

## Notes
[^arse1]: If you don't remember to wind the film on, the next image will superimpose on the the last. Perfect for double exposures, if you're into that.

[^arse2]: You can't release a shutter that ain't cocked, Cock.
