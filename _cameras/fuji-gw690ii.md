My wife and I were out taking photos on a frosty morning at the end of 2019 when we met a chap in the woods with a boxy-looking camera with a waist level viewfinder. This turned out to be a Hasselblad 500 of some kind and I asked him quite a lot of questions about medium format film photography. He had bought his camera at [Ffordes](https://www.ffordes.com/) in Inverness and I bought a dose of GAS[^3] from him. After a fair bit of reading and research, I decided I wanted to give medium format a try.  I bought a Fuji GW690ii[^2] from [ODA-Japan](https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/odacamerajapan) at the end of 2019 for under $500 US, not including P&P, the Amex foreign currency fees, VAT, import duty and local PO handling fees, which brought the actual cost to over £500 Sterling. The camera has a fixed 90mm lens with a 67 mm filter thread.

Because the Fuji doesn’t have a meter, I bought a Gossen Sixtino meter on eBay for £20. There’s also an app for my iPhone that is very convenient.

I had light leask with this camera from the outset, which was disappointing. I took it to [Cameratiks](https://www.cameratiks.co.uk/) in Morningside for a CLA, along with two Nikon FM SLRs, who sorted it out for me.

### Notes
[^2]: This medium format rangefinder is enormous, of circus clown comedy proportions. It is sometimes referred to as the "Texas Leica" for this reason.
[^3]: GAS = Gear Acquisition Syndrome. Photographers get it. Guitarists get it too.
