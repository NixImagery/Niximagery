I do not own a Hasselblad. Yet. This developing article is just a collection of notes on the system for me to refer to as I learn enough about the V-system to be able to acquire my own.

## Introduction and the cost of Hasselblads
Buying your Hasselblad piece by piece seems to be a smart (more economical) way to do it. Whole systems attract a premium -- even at auction, an early 500C in good condition can fetch thousands. I want to build a coherent and decent camera kit without having to hide it from my wife, like [a guy we met](fuji-gw690ii) one frosty morning, out in the countryside with his dirty little secret while his other half was at a car boot sale. I have to say that my wife is not averse to me owning a Hasselblad but we're educators and not that flush, so a little humility and frugality is in order. That said, I have had encouragement in my desire to own a Hasselblad camera system:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">do it ; - )</p>&mdash; Dr David Mitchell (@DSM888) <a href="https://twitter.com/DSM888/status/1334098543984906247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The piece I refer to in that Tweet is David's [personal reflection](https://www.japancamerahunter.com/2020/11/hasselblad-a-personal-reflection/) on the [Japan Camera Hunter](https://www.japancamerahunter.com) blog, in which he sketches the history of Hasselblad and his own passion for the brand. In that  post, David describes the development of the cameras from the early models with focal plane shutters and Kodak lenses, to the copal shuttered Zeiss glass that has been part of the success of the V-series. It is these cameras, that became known as the *V-series*, that I'm keen to explore. David makes an important point that resonates with me:

> "Good design is discreet and intuitive – if it feels like it should do something then well designed things often do – it’s Mac vs PC for me..."

## The parts of the system

There are separate and distinct parts to the V-system that need to work together to make a camera. The *lens* attaches to and works with the *body* to capture light. The body is more than just a box to mount things on to: it houses the controls, the mirror (these are single-lens reflex cameras) and provides the framework for the other system components to interface with. The *viewfinder* is for the operator to compose the scene with, focusing on the *screen*. The *back* captures the image on to film or a digital sensor.

## Timeline

Production | Model | Notes
:--------- | :---: | :-------
1957 -- 1970 | 500 C   | Original Compur leaf-shutter
1970 -- 1994 | 500 C/M | User-changeable screen
1988 -- 1994 | 503 C/X | Built-in TTL flash meter, “Palpas” shutter coating, improved Acute Matte screen
1994 -- 1997 | 501 C   | Complete kit, A12 magazine, 80mm lens 
1997 -- 2005 | 501 C/M | The best Acute Matte D screen, CW winder
1996 -- 2013 | 503 C/W | Improved mirror system

## Bodies
The 500 series cameras, including the super-wide angle SWx (which have fixed lenses), all have a shutter speed from 1 second to 1/500 s (hence the series name). A leaf shutter is in the lens. Later 2000/200 series bodies revert to a focal plane shutter which can fire at up to 1/2000 s. 

Whilst many reviewers and vloggers have 500 CMs, and I really don't care about flash, the newer models with better mirrors, second shutter coatings and a bright screen seem to be more attractive for a first investment: this, because it is likely to be the only investment I make in a system like this. I might as well do it right, and do it once, if I can.

### Designations
The **C** indicates compur-shutter compatible, and **/M** is a *modified* designation. **CX** and **CXi** are TTF/OTF X-sync flash compatible, the **i** meaning *improved*. The SWA super-wide angle bodies are based on the older series one and two cameras (1000 and 1600). F indicates a focal plane shutter with additional letters to indicate compatibility: **FC**, **FCM** and **FCW** are compatible with Compur lenses.

## Lenses
There is a lot of detail out there on the range of lenses in the V-system, and again, [Emulsive](https://emulsive.org/reviews/camera-reviews/hasselblad-camera-reviews/the-hasselblad-v-system-master-guide-c-and-c-t-star-lenses) is your starting point for this. Pertinent details are that most of the lenses are Zeiss glass, with the **C T\*** designation indicating better **T** coatings. The "standard" V-series lens is the Zeiss Planar C 80mm f/2.8, being the diameter of the 56mm square image at the film, and being close to "normal" vision. Some initial preferences for a lens are (all Zeiss  C / C**T\***):

Name    | f | Max | Min | Usage | Filter |Shutter
:-------|----:|:----|:---|:-----|:-------|:------
Distagon| 50mm|f/4|f/22|Landscape|63 mm|Compur Synchro
Distagon| 60mm|f/3.5|f/22|Landscape|B60 bayonet|Compur Synchro
Planar  | 80mm|f/2.8|f/22|General|B50 bayonet|Prontor CF
Planar  |100mm|f/3.5|f/22|Tele, high resolution|B50 bayonet|Compur Synchro
Sonnar C|150mm|f/4|f/32|Portrait|B50 bayonet|Compur Synchro
Sonnar C|250mm|f/5.6|f/45|Portrait|B50 bayonet|Compur Synchro
Tele-Tessar C|350mm|f/5.6|f/45|Tele|B50 bayonet|Compur Synchro

## Backs
Hasselblad have made improvements with each iteration of the film backs: the later type IV backs have a dark slide holder which I imagine will be a very smart thing to have for a system in my hashy hands. If there's a nice safe place to put the dark slide, then I'm less likely to sit on it or drop it in a river. This Hasselblad is going outdoors.

## The hunt begins
So, at best I'm looking for a 503 CW with a 42204 screen; an A12 Type IV back; waist-level viewfinder; and an 80mm Planar, or 250mm Sonnar lens. There is a complete 1998 kit on eBay with the 80mm, boxed, for a buy-it-now price of £2,800 or directly from [the seller](Mifsuds.COM) for £3K. Another 1997 kit with a 2000 back is available with a 6 month warranty for £2K from Cambrian. If I'm more humble about the age of the cameras, there's a 1986 501CM kit for £1300: a private auction of a 1988 503 CX / 80mm T* planar realised the same price.

You do have to take your time and do your homework, I am learning. eBay is almost certainly not the right place to buy anything over £100, because it's full of crims and druggies. Even the reputable-looking places that sell on there, are selling on there for a reason. Check this out, for example:

![](/img/ebayV.jpg)

[Ken Rockwell](https://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/ebay/index.htm)'s guide is right on the money when it comes to evaluating sellers:

> "The seller's feedback rating is a better predictor of the quality of an item than his description of it."

The image above is from a 98.9% positive seller's listing. Ken suggests that: 

> "Good feedback ratings are 99.8% and above. Bad feedback ratings are 99.6% and below. Don't even consider buying from anyone with much less of a feedback rating than 99.5%. When I have, I've often gotten junk."

I've sent Ken [another donation](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/kenrockwell). I was seriously tempted by that 503CW.

As well as David Mitchell's piece in Japan Camera Hunter, I am grateful to a number of authors and publishers for sharing useful guides and instruction on the Hasselblad *marque*, not least of which is the superb [Emulsive Hasselblad V-System Master Guide](https://emulsive.org/reviews/camera-reviews/hasselblad-camera-reviews/the-hasselblad-v-system-master-guide-overview) by Emmett Brown[^nto].  If you're curious about Hasselblad, you could do worse than just read his articles.
