I do not own a Hasselblad. Yet. What I hope to do at first is learn enough about the so-called V-system to be able to acquire a coherent kit, piece by piece, which seems to be the smart (more economical) way to do it. Whole systems attract a premium -- even at auction, an early 500C in good condition will fetch over Â£1,800.

So, this will be just notes on the system for me to refer to as I learn. Eventually, it might record my journey to acquisition. I have some encouragement:

## Notes

The header image is the iconic "Earthrise" taken on Christmas Eve, 1968 by [Bill Anders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders) during the Apollo 8 mission, on a Hasselblad EL/M and Zeiss Sonnar f/5.6 250mm lens.
