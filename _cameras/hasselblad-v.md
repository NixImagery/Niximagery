I do not own a Hasselblad. Yet. This developing article is just a collection of notes on the system for me to refer to as I learn enough about the V-system to be able to acquire my own.

## Introduction and the cost of Hasselblads
Buying your Hasselblad piece by piece seems to be a smart (more economical) way to do it. Whole systems attract a premium -- even at auction, an early 500C in good condition can fetch thousands. I want to build a coherent and decent camera kit without having to hide it from my wife, like [a guy we met](fuji-gw690ii) one frosty morning, out in the countryside with his dirty little secret while his other half was at a car boot sale. I have to say that my wife is not averse to me owning a Hasselblad but we're educators and not that flush, so a little humility and frugality is in order. That said, I have had encouragement in my desire to own a Hasselblad camera system:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">do it ; - )</p>&mdash; Dr David Mitchell (@DSM888) <a href="https://twitter.com/DSM888/status/1334098543984906247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The piece I refer to in that Tweet is David's [personal reflection](https://www.japancamerahunter.com/2020/11/hasselblad-a-personal-reflection/) on the [Japan Camera Hunter](https://www.japancamerahunter.com) blog, in which he sketches the history of Hasselblad and his own passion for the brand. In that  post, David describes the development of the cameras from the early models with focal plane shutters and Kodak lenses, to the copal shuttered Zeiss glass that has been part of the success of the V-series. It is these cameras, that became known as the *V-series*, that I'm keen to explore. David makes an important point that resonates with me:

> "Good design is discreet and intuitive – if it feels like it should do something then well designed things often do – it’s Mac vs PC for me..."

## The parts of the system

There are separate and distinct parts to the V-system that need to work together to make a camera. The *lens* attaches to and works with the *body* to capture light. The body is more than just a box to mount things on to: it houses the controls, the mirror (these are single-lens reflex cameras) and provides the framework for the other system components to interface with. The *viewfinder* is for the operator to compose the scene with, focusing on the *screen*. The *back* captures the image on to film or a digital sensor.

## Timeline
Production | Model | Notes
:--------- | :---: | :-------
1957 -- 1970 | 500 C   | Original Compur leaf-shutter
1970 -- 1994 | 500 C/M | User-changeable screen
1988 -- 1994 | 503 C/X | Built-in TTL flash meter, “Palpas” shutter coating, improved Acute Matte screen
1994 -- 1997 | 501 C   | Complete kit, A12 magazine, 80mm lens 
1997 -- 2005 | 501 C/M | The best Acute Matte D screen, CW winder
1996 -- 2013 | 503 C/W | Improved mirror system

## Bodies
The 500 series cameras, including the super-wide angle SWC bodies, have a top shutter speed of 1/500 s (hence the series name). The leaf shutter is in the lens. Later 2000/200 series bodies revert to a focal plane shutter which can fire at up to 1/2000 s. 

### Designations
The **C** indicates compur-shutter compatible, and **/M** is a *modified* designation. **CX** and **CXi** are TTF/OTF X-sync flash compatible, the **i** meaning *improved*.

The SWA super-wide angle bodies are based on the older series one and two cameras (1000 and 1600).

F indicates a focal plane shutter with additional letters to indicate compatibility: **FC**, **FCM** and **FCW** are compatible with Compur lenses.

As well as David Mitchell's piece in Japan Camera Hunter, I am grateful to a number of authors and publishers for sharing useful guides and instruction on the Hasselblad *marque*, not least of which is the superb [Emulsive Hasselblad V-System Master Guide](https://emulsive.org/reviews/camera-reviews/hasselblad-camera-reviews/the-hasselblad-v-system-master-guide-overview) by Emmett Brown[^nto].  If you're curious about Hasselblad, you could do worse than just read his articles.

[^nto]: No, not [that one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Brown). [The other one](https://www.facebook.com/emulsive.overlord). He says that his site is not his "day job" yet so he tends to be professionally coy, using the epithet, "EM".

The header image is the iconic "Earthrise" taken on Christmas Eve, 1968 by [Bill Anders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders) during the Apollo 8 mission, on a Hasselblad EL/M and Zeiss Sonnar f/5.6 250mm lens.
