I do not own a Hasselblad. Yet. What I hope to do at first is learn enough about the so-called V-system to be able to acquire a coherent kit, piece by piece, which seems to be the smart (more economical) way to do it. Whole systems attract a premium -- even at auction, an early 500C in good condition will fetch over Â£1,800.

So, this will be just notes on the system for me to refer to as I learn. Eventually, it might record my journey to acquisition. I have some encouragement:

## Sources

I am grateful to a number of authors and publishers for sharing their useful guides and instruction on the Hasselblad *marque*, not least of which is the superb [Emulsive Hasselblad V-System Master Guide](https://emulsive.org/reviews/camera-reviews/hasselblad-camera-reviews/the-hasselblad-v-system-master-guide-overview) by Emmett Brown[^nto].  If you're curious about Hasselblad, you could do worse than just read his articles.

[^nto]: No, not [that one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Brown). [The other one](https://www.facebook.com/emulsive.overlord). He says that his site is not his "day job" yet so he tends to be professionally coy, using the epithet, "EM".

The header image is the iconic "Earthrise" taken on Christmas Eve, 1968 by [Bill Anders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders) during the Apollo 8 mission, on a Hasselblad EL/M and Zeiss Sonnar f/5.6 250mm lens.
