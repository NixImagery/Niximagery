My first "proper" camera was a Nikon FM SLR, which I bought second hand around 1977 in Hitchin with a 50mm lens. I soon after bought a Tamron 80-210mm zoom lens that I used from the 1980s until around 2002 when I boxed it all up and hid it for a few years. I have no idea what happened to the 50mm lens but the body was checked out by [Lehmanns](https://www.hlehmann.co.uk/) in 2019 who condemned the shutter mechanism as BER[^1]. 

I then bought another Nikon FM from [SE Cameras](https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/secameras) in April 2019 for £90, along with a Nikon AI-s 50mm f/1.8 lens from the same seller for £80. That lens is one of the cheaper E series lenses and I’m not totally happy with the quality of it, so I have bought a Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8 lens on [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/photosound09) for £169. I’m also tempted by the 85mm f/1.4 but these are considerably pricier on eBay at the moment. Both lenses have a standard 52 mm filter ring.

Having had some problems with light leaks with the eBay FM, I took it to [Cameratiks](https://www.cameratiks.co.uk/) in Morningside for a CLA, along with my orginial "condemned" FM and the Fuji GW690ii. For a couple of hundred quid, I got not only my "mint" condition eBay bargains back in decent working order, they also manged to return my original FM to full working condition.
