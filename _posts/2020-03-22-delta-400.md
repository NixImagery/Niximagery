Ilford Delta is a well-known black and white film from the famous UK manufacturer that has been around for almost 30 years. I put a roll of Ilford Delta 400 through a Nikon FM over a few weeks. This post describes some of the images I made and what I did with them. The film was exposed over the first few weeks of 2020 and sent to AG Photographic in Birmingham for developing.

## Harlow Water
We had to take a trip to Essex in January and had time to take a walk along the River Stort, a dirty looking river that runs through a dirty looking town on the outskirts of London. The river seems clean enough to sustain life, though, as there were people fishing along the banks. The first image here is a crop: bottom right you can see fading from what looks like a light leak in the camera. I think it's somethign to do with the back plate. I bought this camera from eBay to replace my original 1970s Nikon FM that has a condemned shutter, and the back doesn't shut cleanly with the satisfyin click of my original.

Not sure I'd be eating any of the fish they caught, as there were dog walkers kicking their poochy-poo directly from where it was dropped on the tow path into the river.

The next image has been adjusted for tone in Capture One for a more vintage look.

## The Fife Coast
I continued the split toning exercise with the next two frames, toning the shadows blue and the highlights in the complementary yellow.

Here, the Forth River basks in sunrays from an approaching storm. The toning enhances, I think the menacing clouds and waters.

## Kinghorn Beach
The last of these photographs is untoned but suffers with the same light leak problem I talked about above. This image was taken in portrait orientation and cropped slightly to make use of the false flare. I think it looks OK.

## Summary of the results
Reviews of this film suggest that it is very sharp, although I am sure that this is true only when in better hands. I am not convinced that I get the best results by sending it to AG Photographic, although I don't doubt they are the best of the labs out there. Perhaps this is just a manifestation of the Dunning-Kruger effect. 

## Next steps
I will try this film again and process it myself to see if I get better results, but also maybe I ought to stop buying old cameras online and expecting them to perform optimally without at least letting someone who knows what they are doing check them over for me.
