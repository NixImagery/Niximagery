We went down to Gifford, in East Lothian, to find that the new owners of the farm have made walkers on his land very unwelcome. I wasn't in the mood for a fight, so we took a drive down to the golf club, where we were welcome to park, provided that we let them know in the clubhouse. It's nice to know there are still public-spirited folk out there.

**Part of the keep remains**

A walk alongside the bunkers and greensward took us to one of our favourite haunts, Goblin Ha'. This magical place has been here for almost a thousand years and is full of stories and little hidey-places. The remains of the castle and keep are here, along with a subterranean crypt that can be accessed with care: the path is slippery and dangerous at the best of times, let alone in the wet seasons.

**The underground crypt from outside**

This was a family outing: a chance for some of us to spend quality time together in this natural and mystical place, right for reflection. The setting was good for clearing heads and strengthening bonds. Little discoveries and the distraction of mindful photography made for a perfect autumnal break from the madness.

I developed this film in 1:150 Rodinal R09 for an hour and scanned it on my Epson V600 at 4800 dpi. Most of the images are about 100 Mega pixels at that resolution and the negatives are nice and sharp. Not bad for a fifty-year old folder that cost me about the same as the roll of film did.
