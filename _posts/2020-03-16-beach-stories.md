## Imagined back stories of things found on the beach
Most of these images were made in November 2019 at Clashnessie, in the Assynt. There is an album on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/gp/mrhood/4Q9mx9) where you can see higher resolution versions of these images and a few more. The stories may have been extended a little.

## The backwards aerial with half twist

A difficult manoeuvre to perform with grace, it can be done with concentration and a great deal of practice. She had thought mindfully all morning as she prepared, emptying her head of distractions and day to day concerns. When the moment came, she was ready: time stood still and the crowd were hushed.

## Epsilon

Berry-like prophecies of Christmas coming, arms reaching forward in time. I thought I could see the shape of a letter E, moving to the right of frame.

## The Argentine Tango

Carlos and Eva seemed to defy the laws of gravity as they danced their contragiros. Onlookers would gasp as she poured herself over his limbs in a steamy, sensuous, syncopated embrace.

## Kestrel

He glides, and hovers on the imperceptible breeze, scanning for little violet trickles and traces that betray the poor vole, scurrying, hopping, scampering along, cursing his evolutionary luck.
