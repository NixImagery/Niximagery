The header image will give you a sense of what we had hoped for. That image is actually a stitch of 8 images taken with the X-T2 and 35mm f/2 lens. Each image was exposed at f/8, 1/125s at ISO 200 and assembled into a panorama in Capture One. It should make a nice print about 50 inches x 20 inches if I ever get around to that.

On the ferry from Loch Maddy back to Uig, I managed to connect to wifi. This was timely, as I discovered that my application for fellowhip of the IoP had been successful.
