Black and white panchromatic film, cost Â£5.25 per roll from Analog Wonderland. Loaded August 2020, in camera until October 2020. Used with a yellow filter, the ISO on camera meter was set to 64 ASA to compensate 2/3 stop for it. Developed at AG labs, 36 exposures, last exposure details not recorded, but they were taken mostly at Braefoot Bay terminal, Fife, and included images of a building at Charles Hill Battery. The image of that building shown here was cropped slightly and adjusted in Capture One.
