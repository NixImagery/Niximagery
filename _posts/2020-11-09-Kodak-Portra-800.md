More images from our recent anniversary trip to Dunkeld in October. These are from a roll of Kodak Portra 800 taken with my Nikon FM. This is my second roll of Kodak's pastelly colour negative film[^aw] in a 35mm camera[^fm], after a service by Cameratiks in Morningside.  I didn't record exposure settings for this film, having got out of the habit -- for deliberate mindfulness in my photography, rather than laziness.

The header image is the unmistakable bridge at Ossian's Hall, which runs over the river Braan. Autumn's colours were everywhere on this trip.

[^aw]: This roll cost £12.50 per roll from Analog Wonderland. The roll was sent to [AG Photolab](https://www.ag-photolab.co.uk/) for processing at about £3.49 plus P&P. About 45p per image.

[^fm]: I bought this, my first film SLR camera back in the 1970's, second-hand, for about £125 including a 50mm Nikon lens. That lens is long gone -- part-exchanged, maybe, for the Tamron 80--200mm zoom that was on this camera for much of its first life.
