Monday 10th February, 2020. 

## Coming home
No early adventures for us today but we didn't have to leave the house to see a range of weather, including a gorgeous sunrise and snow from the lounge window. We packed and I loaded my last roll of film, a Kodak Portra 160. Replenishing the hire car's tank with about 20 litres of petrol cost about 200 Króna, the same as a single adult ticket to walk on the land nearby. We stopped at the huts in the place Kara had seen from that walk yesterday, and I ran of the final frames before packing the exposed rolls into a poly bag for easy security inspection at the airport.

Check in made us feel like children again as a nice lady talked us through getting a luggage tag

<!-- ## Sandavágur
We drove down to Sandavágur for the sunrise, which was wintery. Kara played with waves and the seals and I took a photo of the floodlit church which didn't turn out the way I hoped. This is the church, taken the next day with Fuji Pro 400H. -->
