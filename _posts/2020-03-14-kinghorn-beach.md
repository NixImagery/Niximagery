Saturday 14th March, 2020. 

With the COVID-19 pandemic evolving around us, a spot of sea air was in order, so we drove along the coast to Kinghorn.

## New friends
I had film to finish off in the Texas Leica, my Nikon FM and my newest and cheapest (so far) photographic GAS[^1], an Agfa Isolette I which arrived with half a roll of (I think) unexposed Kodacolor II still in it. [This post](https://www.photomemorabilia.co.uk/Colour_Darkroom/Early_Kodak_CameraFilm.html#anchorK11) tells me that this film was rated at 100 ASA and went out of production in 1983. I don't expect very much from the three or four images I made with it, but it was fun trying out this old toy. The lens seems a little grubby but otherwise the camera seems to be clean and in good order for its age, and worth the Â£18 punted on it on eBay.

See [this post](/2020/03/21/1983-kodacolorII.html) for how the images from this film turned out.

## Beach life
The sky over Edinburgh across the Forth was pretty dramatic, so we were excited to see a group of parasurfers setting up and enjoying the elements. There was a stiff breeze as the tide was coming in, so the waves were expressive and obviously not a small challenge for the boys and girls braving the wind chill. We had our own challenge with the rapidly incoming tide.
