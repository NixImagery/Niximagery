*Thomas and his gate. Fuji GW 690ii*

Winter brings many charms, not the least of which is snow. There's a smell to it that takes me back to childhood. With the COVID restrictions, we can't go far, but we are lucky enough to have nearby places that keep us within travel limits and yet at a distance from other people.

This picture and those that follow were taken on a walk up Common Hill near Glendevon. We took poles with us, and crampons on our boots, to make the climb and descent more pleasant and less like hard work.![](/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-160-20210223_09083923.jpg)

*Blow, blow, thou winter wind,  
  Thou art not so unkind as manâ€™s ingratitude;  
  Thy tooth is not so keen, because thou art not seen,  
     Although thy breath be rude.* -- William Shakespeare
