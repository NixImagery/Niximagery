Saturday 8th February, 2020. 

## Reflections
Studying the local guide map over coffee and a biscuit, I realise how ignorant I feel about the place and culture I am in. This, as a consequence of the pace of life I am leading, ironically to pay for the privilege of travel. I will no doubt go home full of resolutions to do something about this, which will be dragged into the quicksand of daily hustle and bustle, leaving only the guilt as trace that I ever made them.

## Sandav치gur
Before breakfast we drove down to Sandav치gur for the sunrise, which was unspectacular. I took a photo of the floodlit church and Kara played with waves and the seals.

## T칩rshavn
