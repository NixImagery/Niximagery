Saturday 8th February, 2020. 

## Reflections
Studying the local guide map over coffee and a biscuit, I realise how ignorant I feel about the place and culture I am in. This, as a consequence of the pace of life I am leading, ironically to pay for the privilege of travel. I will no doubt go home full of resolutions to do something about this, which will be dragged into the quicksand of daily hustle and bustle, leaving only the guilt as trace that I ever made them.

## Sandavágur
We drove down to Sandavágur for the sunrise, which was wintery. Kara played with waves and the seals and I took a photo of the floodlit church which didn't turn out the way I hoped. This is the church, taken the next day with Fuji Pro 400H.

## Trøllkonufingur
We drove to the Witch's Finger (Trøllkonufingur) and walked along far enough to see the stack and promised to return to catch the sun rising here tomorrow.

## Tórshavn
After a good breakfast we headed for the Streymoy tunnel and Tórshavn, where we ate extremely expensive sushi. One of the delights of the Faroes is that they have not learned how to do tourism yet, with its expected levels of service. Certainly our waitress hadn't done the course. I'm not complaining - it's nice to have the feeling that you're not just following in the footsteps of 80 million people before you, taking the same photos. I didn't take many photos in the town: it's nice, and there is a harbour and some old buildings but it was raining and I was happy just experiencing the place.
