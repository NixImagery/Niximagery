It's been a long time since there has been time for photography: life, COVID, and other everyday challenges have conspired to distract us from our one-time major non-work activity. A trip to the Hebrides for a short summer break demanded at least some effort, so I took my [Fuji X-T2](/_cameras/fuji-x-t2.md) and three lenses; the [Ricoh GR-III](/_cameras/ricoh-gr-iii.md); and one concession to analogue photography, the [Agfa Isolette](/_cameras/afga-isolette.md).

We drove cross-country from the Forth to Skye Bridges, taking our time to shop a little at the House of Bruar (one *has to*, surely) and dally at Sligachan bridge, an old favourite of ours with a newish statue to the mountaineers Prof. Norman Collie and John Mackenzie.

**Statue of Collie and Mackenzie** at Glen Sligachan. X-T2 with a Nikon 85mm f/1.4 lens.

The 50-year-old Nikon lens holds up nicely on the Fuji. Wide-open at f/1.4 I find it very hard to get the focus exact -- the depth of field is very narrow -- but it is still a very nice lens for softening the background. It performs better on the Nikon it was designed for, being quite dark on the Fuji compared to the Fuji XF 90mm f/2.

**Glen Sligachan**, X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4 lens at about f/4.

The header image of Collie and Mackenzie's Cuillins was also taken with the same camera and lens and shows off, in my view, the distinct colour profile of the Nikon glass. Make your own mind up whether you prefer the filmic shades of the Nikon over the technically superior and brilliant Fuji lenses.

Overnighting at a Hostel in Portree, we took the early ferry from Uig to Loch Maddy. I am always impressed with CalMac's well-oiled operation, especially compared to the sometimes stressful experience of air travel. The 90 minute crossing was smooth and only slightly disappointing for not spotting seals at Vaternish Point. We consoled ourselves with a bacon and egg banjo in the "Mariners" caf√©.
