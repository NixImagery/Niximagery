# NixImagery
This is a collection of repositories which contain websites, data and documentation assoicated with various strands of my work and business. Some are private, others not so.

My Technical blog is located at https://cullaloe.com/ and contains posts on coding, technical matters and things related to my online services like the VPS that hosts the various websites I operate. Some of those posts have been migrated from the old WordPress site. The site is built with code from the [Galada](https://jekyll-themes.com/galada/) Jekyll theme.

My Photography blog which gives the name to this GitHub account is hosted at github pages and located at https://niximagery.com/. It is based on [Jekyll Minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) and includes Kushagra's [search](https://github.com/chinchang/super-search).

Other public sites here are related to [my family tales](https://cullaloe.com/family), interdisciplinary learning at the [Natural Partners Project](https://naturalpartnersproject.org/), the 2020 [Data Ethics MOOC](https://cullaloe.com/DataEthicsMOOC/) run by the University of Edinburgh, and the remnants of the old Scottish Physics Teachers' Resources site [SPTR](https://sptr.net/).

I am a Lecturer and PhD student at Edinburgh University. I maintain an interest in programming, artificial intelligence and pedagogy. You can find my current cv [here](http://cullaloe.com/cv.pdf) (pdf, 100kB).
