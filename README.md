# NixImagery
This is a collection of repositories which contain websites, data and documentation associated with various strands of my work and business. Some are private, others not so.

My Technical blog is located at https://cullaloe.com/ and contains posts on coding, technical matters, education and research. That site is built with code from the [Galada](https://jekyll-themes.com/galada/) Jekyll theme.

My Photography blog which gives the name to this GitHub account is hosted at github pages and located at https://niximagery.com/. Since July 2023, it is based on the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) web publishing system.

Other public sites here are related to [my family tales](https://cullaloe.com/family), interdisciplinary learning at the [Natural Partners Project](https://naturalpartnersproject.org/), the 2020 [Data Ethics MOOC](https://cullaloe.com/DataEthicsMOOC/) run by the University of Edinburgh, and the remnants of the old Scottish Physics Teachers' Resources site [SPTR](https://sptr.net/). These are variously built with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), Jekyll, or Bookdown.

I am a Lecturer and PhD student at Edinburgh University. I maintain an interest in programming, artificial intelligence and multimodal pedagogy, in particular, sound-based. You can find my current cv [here](https://github.com/NixImagery/CV/blob/master/cv.pdf) (pdf, 175kB).
