# NixImagery
This is a collection of repositories which contain websites, data and documentation associated with various strands of my work and business. Some are private, others not so.

My Photography blog which gives the name to this GitHub account is hosted at github pages and located at https://niximagery.com/. Since July 2023, it is based on the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) web publishing system.

Other public sites here are related to [my family tales](https://cullaloe.com/family).

I am a retired Lecturer, now PhD student at Edinburgh University. I maintain an interest in programming, artificial intelligence and multimodal pedagogy, in particular, sound-based. You can find my current cv [here](https://github.com/NixImagery/CV/blob/master/cv.pdf) (pdf, 175kB).
