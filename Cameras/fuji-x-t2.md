# Fuji X-T2

The Fuji X-T2 is a superbly designed and made digital camera. It has a substantial feel to it and everything works. The quality of the Fuji prime lenses is superb and when used on this camera, produces some stunning images. My first Fuji was an X-E2 rangefinder and I do love a rangefinder: the experience with this camera led me to buy a [Fuji GW690](fuji-gw690ii.md) but I missed using the SLR form camera that I had learned on (a [Nikon FM](nikon-fm.md)) and so I bought the X-T2.

It took a long time to see a reason to upgrade to a newer versions of the X-T camera, and I remain tempted by the GFX cameras. Having bought an [X-T5](fuji-x-t5.md), I have not parted with this incredible camera.
