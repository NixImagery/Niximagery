# Fuji GW690ii

![](/img/GW690ii-faroes.jpg)
**The GW690ii in action** in February 2020 during a trip to the Faroes.

I bought a Fuji GW690ii[^2] from [ODA-Japan](https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/odacamerajapan) at the end of 2019 for under $500 US, not including P&P, the Amex foreign currency fees, VAT, import duty and local PO handling fees, which brought the actual cost to over £500 Sterling. The camera has a fixed 90mm lens with a 67 mm filter thread.

Because the Fuji doesn’t have a meter, I bought a Gossen Sixtino meter on eBay for £20. There’s also an app for my iPhone that is very convenient.

I had light leaks with this camera from the outset, which was disappointing. I took it to [Cameratiks](https://www.cameratiks.co.uk/) in Morningside for a CLA, along with two Nikon FM SLRs, who sorted it out for me.

I took the camera for a proper outing before the CLA, on a trip to the Faroes, which was part of our honeymoon in instalments. It was pretty nice:

The camera is completely mechanical and therefore fully manual. A fixed lens, and nothing to change except the aperture and shutter: both are adjusted by adjacent rings on the front of the lens. This is neat, because once you've got your EI worked out and set a shutter for a given aperture, you can turn both rings together, keeping the exposure but adjusting for (say) depth of field.
