The first time I tried this film, I wrecked it with a stupid mistake in developing. This time, I sent it to AG photo for processing, not so much because I was afraid to develop it myself, but more because I have been too busy to do my own processing. 

This roll I put through my little old Afga Isolette. Not much detail in the exposure list below because I have ditched the neurotic habit of writing down every exposure setting of every frame. I've enjoyed my photography more, although I am less certain of good results. Hopefully my success rate will improve with practice, if I learn anything as I go.

The roll was exposed during a weekend break at Dunkeld.

At the Hermitage, looking towards the bridge.

These were scanned on my Epson V600 and post processed in Capture One for levels, colour and cropping.
