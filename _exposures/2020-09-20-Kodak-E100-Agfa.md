I didn't record the rest of the exposure details, but went broadly with "sunny 16", occasionally referring to an app on my iPhone. It was a bright, partly sunny day, and I took some of the shots at 1/50 s hand-held, although some were at 1/200 s or between these two. Apertures were between f/8 and f/16, mostly. I finished the film and sent it to AG for developing with another E100 I had finished in the Fuji GW690ii.
