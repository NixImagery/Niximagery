I decided to "semi-stand" develop this film in Rodinal[^which] at 1+99 (in English, 1% solution by volume) for an hour. Stand development means no agitation: solutions must therefore be gently poured into the Paterson tank, to avoid bubbles of air being trapped between the film surfaces. This process is called semi-stand because of the turn half-way through. I followed the recipe kindly posted by [Gerald Greenwood](https://geraldo.me.uk/stand-development-with-rodinal-a-guide-based-on-my-own-experience/). That post is well worth a read and made me laugh out loud. Gerald seems to be a man after my own heart: bored with manly men acting like boys comparing toys, and just wanting good, consistent results.

[^which]: R09 One Shot.
