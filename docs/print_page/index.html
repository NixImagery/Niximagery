<p>Speaking of Kings, we <a href="#..-stories-2022-2022-10-08-the-glen">went for a walk in Pittencrieff Park</a> (known locally as "The Glen"). We were hunting for autumn leaves for an artsy project, specifically Oak. A walk in a park is never a bad idea in my book, and it gave me a chance to re-introduce myself to the big Fuji XF100-400mm zoom lens that I got back from service and repair this week. After lunch, we had an errand to run in the Lang Toun which gave us an excuse to take another walk, this time <a href="#..-stories-2022-2022-10-08b-dysart">around the harbour at Dysart</a>.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don't know how people find the time. Life is full of challenges and yet others seem to manage it. I am too busy: working, with daily stuff to do, a PhD project under way, keeping up with my reading, music, sketching and helping my wife with her garden projects.</p>

<strong>Time and tide wait for no man</strong></p>
<p>There are sometimes stories to go with pictures I make. I wanted to try to make a space where I can, if I can find the time, tell the stories of the images. Or maybe post the images of the stories. Whatever. This is one of those places, although I am increasingly eschewing the digital spaces I have (over)inhabited. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it. </p>
<p>Getting around is easy: click on pictures to see a gallery of the images on any page. On a desktop browser, click the <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> keys to navigate forward and backwards.</p>
<p>The website is built on  the <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/">Material for MkDocs</a> Python framework.</p>

<p>I appreciate the power of social media but I hate gratutious and cynical commercial exploitation with a passion. I do keep a presence on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/niximagery/">Instagram</a>, more to browse the work of good artists than anything else. I hate what Mark Zuckerberg's lack of class has done to the platform and will likely very soon ditch it, as I have ditched Facebook pages, Twitter, Tumblr and the rest.</p>
<div class="admonition example inline end">
<p class="admonition-title">Flickr</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/niximagery/">Flickr</a> is a different case. The people behind that space have weathered the storm of fashion and survive on a hybrid free/subscription based model. The groups and forums on Flickr have been helpful to me so I pay the fee when I can afford it. I recently (July 2022) archived all of the content I had there and am building it up gently to a moderate presence.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://500px.com/p/niximagery?view=photos">500px</a> started well but were bought out by a Chinese media company. That killed it for many users, for whom there was a real sense of belonging, especially with the Global Photowalks that 500px got behind -- I am still friends with many of the people I met at <a href="https://500px.com/search?q=500pxGPW15&amp;type=photos&amp;sort=pulse">the 2015 London event</a> -- but that has also been spoiled by the acquisition. I sustain a free account there, and have noticed a new interest from the people behind the platform in developing their community. They have recently increased the upload limit (to 21 images per week, plenty for me) so perhaps it will improve.</p>

<p>My name is Nick Hood. Jack of All, Master of None and perpetually frustrated by that. I have had the privilege of enjoying travel and adventure in my various careers, and have picked up more tricks than scars on the way.

<p>Storytelling is one of man's oldest cultural habits, and the evidence we have for this is in the images our ancestors left behind. From the earliest cave paintings to the <em>insta</em> trophy, we record from imagination and experience the world around us. Photography is the ubiquitous manifestation of this in much of the contemporary world we inhabit, so much so that the art of capturing images might seem trivial. In these pages are some of my own images, with perhaps some thoughts or stories to go with them using my powerful ally, words. Here I have the advantage over the cave painter: I can express or explain context to help the observer make sense of the image on the screen. You are at liberty to make your own mind up, of course, and you should critically engage.</p></section>

<strong>The Cuillins</strong>, X-T2, Nikon 85mm</p>
<p>It's been a long time since there has been time for photography: life, COVID, and other everyday challenges have conspired to distract us from our one-time major non-work activity. A trip to the Hebrides for a short summer break demanded at least some effort, so I took my <a href="#_cameras-fuji-x-t2.md">Fuji X-T2</a> and three lenses; the <a href="#_cameras-ricoh-gr-iii.md">Ricoh GR-III</a>; and one concession to analogue photography, the <a href="#_cameras-afga-isolette.md">Agfa Isolette</a>.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2022-2022-07-12-hebridean-trip-skye">Skye</h2>
<p>We drove cross-country from the Forth to Skye Bridges, taking our time to shop a little at the House of Bruar (one <em>has to</em>, surely) and dally at Sligachan bridge, an old favourite of ours with a newish statue to the mountaineers Prof. Norman Collie and John Mackenzie.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9090.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9090.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Statue of Collie and Mackenzie</strong> at Glen Sligachan. X-T2 with a Nikon 85mm f/1.4 lens.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old Nikon lens holds up nicely on the Fuji. Wide-open at f/1.4 I find it very hard to get the focus exact -- the depth of field is very narrow -- but it is still a very nice lens for softening the background. It performs better on the Nikon it was designed for, being quite dark on the Fuji compared to the Fuji XF 90mm f/2.</p>

<strong>Glen Sligachan</strong>, X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4 lens at about f/4.</p>
<p>The header image of Collie and Mackenzie's Cuillins was also taken with the same camera and lens and shows off, in my view, the distinct colour profile of the Nikon glass. Make your own mind up whether you prefer the filmic shades of the Nikon over the technically superior and brilliant Fuji lenses.</p>

<strong>The iconic Portree harbour houses</strong>, Ricoh GR III at f/11, cropped.</p>
<p>Overnighting at a Hostel in Portree, we took the early ferry from Uig to Loch Maddy. I am always impressed with CalMac's well-oiled operation, especially compared to the sometimes stressful experience of air travel. The 90 minute crossing was smooth and only slightly disappointing for not spotting seals at Vaternish Point. We consoled ourselves with a bacon and egg banjo in the "Mariners" café.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2022-2022-07-12-hebridean-trip-five-islands">Five Islands</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9112.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9112.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The first couple of days in our remote "pod" were quite overcast with an ever-present wind between 20 and 40 mph, as the rest of the UK was baking in a record-breaking heat wave. It was nice, actually, and gave us a chance to explore comfortably and get a feel for the local group of islands. </p>

<strong>East Beach, Berneray</strong> Fuji X-T2, XF16mm f/1.4 lens at f/11, 1/250s, ISO 200.</p>
<p>The colours of the water and the machair were striking, different at every location and under the changing light. The sands are also rich with pattern and shade (below). The header image on this page was taken at Traigh Lar on North Uist which became one of our favourite places on our short trip. It was captured with the Fuji X-T2 and the XF16mm f/1.4 lens at f/16 to get the depth of field required to keep the grass in focus as well as the horizon. 1/1000s to freeze the waves, ISO 1000. There was a steep drop of about 20 m to the beach from this point.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9095.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9095.jpg"/></a>
<strong>East Beach sands, Berneray</strong> Fuji X-T2, XF16mm f/1.4 lens at f/8, 1/1250, ISO 200.</p>
<p>Back on East Beach, the sands are also rich with pattern and texture. The countryside is rich with signs that it is expensive to dispose of old machinery and vehicles. Some effort seems to be made to at least gather the wreckage together. At Baleshare, a small collection of refrigerated trailers was forming. This one has signs of another era, like you see when shops change hands and ancient signwriting appears for a while.</p>

<h2 id="stories-2022-2022-07-12-hebridean-trip-to-eriskay-and-back">To Eriskay and back</h2>
<p>We drove the length of the Outer Hebrides, at least without leaving the land. There are many causeways now connecting the various island communities and making commerce and life in general much easier for the people who live and work here. We visited five islands: North and South Uist, Berneray, Benbecula and Eriskay. We're not counting Baleshare, although it connects to North Uist by another causeway. Most of the time one side of the causeway is all sand, and when it's not, you could probably still wade across. We didn't test that theory.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9117.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9117.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Howmore Bothy</strong> (Fuji, Nikon 85mm lens)</p>
<p>Everywhere there are what seems like abandoned or derelict buildings. This example I photographed with both the Fuji (above) and the Ricoh (below) to create a different mood. I'm not sure how successful it is: the wider angle of the Ricoh allows more context to create a story with.</p>

<strong>Howmore Bothy</strong> (Ricoh, 18mm lens)</p>
<p>What really captured my heart during our leisurely and unstructured schlep around these islands was the sheer loveliness of the flowers that are just everywhere, clearly loved and protected by the local people. The wildflower meadowland that edges the beaches and reaches inland is diverse and colourful. I took far too many photographs of these flowers but will not tire of them as they adorn my desktop and walls in the coming months. Here, from the beach at Eriskay, right by the Barra Ferry terminal, is Sea Rocket:</p>

<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9159.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9159.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Locals</strong> Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm</p>
<p>The islands have a thriving farming sector and there are sheep on every single-track road personally introducing themselves to foreign visitors. Birds are many and diverse: it is easy to see a host of sea birds in and around the machar and on the hillsides are Golden Eagles, Hen Harriers and short-eared owls hunting in the daytime.</p>
<!-- Local drivers are used to them and know how much care is required: visitors must err on the side of caution or display the appropriate yellow sticker in the back window to warn other road users. -->
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9157.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9157.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Locals</strong> Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm</p>
<p>The diversity of the wildlife is noticeable for visitors like us from the central belt of Scotland. We seem to have a disproportionate seagull population and we can probably do with less of the fat pigeons and magpies, frankly.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9149.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9149.jpg"/></a>
Where once working families lived, now stand more mechanised, efficient farming practices that make use of the land by fewer humans. A still nascent tourism industry is booked to capacity and locals still wave as visitors yield the right of way in the passing places. There is potential for development of abandoned plots and buildings across the islands. I hope that never comes to spoil the place.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/R0001301.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/R0001301.jpg"/></a>
<strong>The roadside food wagon</strong> is no innovation nor is it a quaint enterprise: the food is home-made, delicious and locally sourced. You have to try the scallops and black pudding roll. Radio buzzers notify in your car when your lunch is ready and yes, they take contactless American Express. Check out the recycling bins. Even the coffee-cup lids are made of paper pulp. The Outer Hebrideans are right on trend when it comes to sustainable service.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9180.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9180.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Sea birds</strong> abound along the shorelines and there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sites_of_Special_Scientific_Interest_in_Western_Isles_South">sites of special scientific interest</a> intended to protect the diverse species, not least those that depend on the environment to breed and thrive. There are as many halfwits who will open gates to drive their SUVs across these spaces to access their picnics, of course but we think we saw at least one person openly challenge such behaviour.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9166.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9166.jpg"/></a>
Most precious and beautiful of the environmental backdrop here is the machair. It is looked after and protected, as far as one can protect from human activity. Here may be common buttercups and clover but if you look, you can see many kinds of orchid.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2022-2022-07-12-hebridean-trip-au-revoir">Au Revoir</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9206_Panorama.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9206_Panorama.jpg"/></a>
This image will give you a sense of what we had hoped for when we headed North on our holiday. That image is actually a stitch of 8 images taken with the X-T2 and 35mm f/2 lens. Each image was exposed at f/8, 1/125s at ISO 200 and assembled into a panorama in Capture One. It should make a nice print about 50 inches x 20 inches if I ever get around to that.</p>
<p>Our sixth island of the trip was Skye, of course, our gateway to the Outer Hebrides. The hills and skies of Skye are something to behold: a mere photograph, least of all a digital image on a computer screen, can't give you anything like the sense of <em>being there</em>. I tried with images like this pano, taken from the side of the road on the way from Carbost, not far from Sligachan where this series of posts began.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9283_Panorama.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9283_Panorama.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The Broadford Co-Op was full of surprises. The cheapest diesel I've bought for weeks, and the right range of snacks for the rest of the journey home. Oh, and this view from the car park:</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9289_Panorama.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9289_Panorama.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What we got from our trip was much better than we had hoped for, of course. We had the chance to explore and learn, visit and revisit under changing skies and light. We left with just the tip of a toe dipped in Hebridean life. In the end, I only took one photo with the Agfa. I forget what it was but no doubt it will pop out in a few months.</p></section><section class="print-page" id="stories-2022-2022-08-07-east-neuk"><h1 id="stories-2022-2022-08-07-east-neuk-east-neuk-day-trip">East Neuk Day Trip</h1>
<p>We took a holiday hurl up the coast, just to take some air and not do the things that seem to have eaten the summer. We were lucky enough to get to the Hebrides, of course, but have managed to do other things too. Today was about switching off for a wee road trip along the fabulous Fife coast.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2022-2022-08-07-east-neuk-st-monans-church">St Monans Church</h2>

I am particularly pleased with this 87 megapixel image of the church that is connected so intimately with my wife's family and her heritage. She has family in the church yard here and the iconic church deserves a decent place in our gallery. I hope to print this.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2022-2022-08-07-east-neuk-the-fife-machair">The Fife Machair</h2>

<strong>The Fife Machair</strong> is out in full bloom, with flowers of all colours basking in the sunshine. There seem to be fewer poppies than usual, for some reason, but we found a few near Kilconquhar.</p>
<p>All of the images in this post, except the St Monan's beach steps below, were taken with my lightweight kit of the Fuji X-T2 and the amazing XF 35mm f2 lens. I've been making more large images recently, when using the digital kit, by stitching several images together, not unlike the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenizer_Method">Brenizer method</a>.</p>

<strong>St. Monans beach steps</strong> For this image, taken as we returned from a walk along the path above the beach at St Monans, I used my old Nikon 85mm lens, stitching two images for a nice large square printable photo.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2022-2022-08-07-east-neuk-poppies">Poppies</h2>

<strong>Poppies</strong> are the flowers of remembrance and I can't spend time with poppies without feeling the emotions they invoke and what they signify. That culture is fading, I think, even as we are today, in time of war. People in some of my circles seem to be offended by remembrance and what used to be the importance of it. So long as I am able, I will not forget. So long as there are poppies, we will all be reminded, even if we choose to forget.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon, for no good reason and many, we jumped in the car with some snacks and went hunting for fresh air and ice cream. We went for a stroll down at Loch Leven. Walking out on the jetty, we saw the light was perfect and a heron was posing nicely along the shore. Of course, by the time we walked back to the car for our cameras, he was gone.  The ice cream was easy, Giacopazzi's in Kinross providing a very nice solution. Cookies and Cream for him, Peach Melba for her. </p>

<strong>Loch Leven</strong> Fuji X-T2, 35mm f/2. Stitch of four images.</p>
<p>Onwards to a partly aimless drive to explore some favourite roads: through Milnathort, out by Tillyrie and Athron Hill where we had a look at a housing development seriously out of our range. Who needs a house that big anyway?</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9479.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9479.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Stronachie Forest</strong> X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4</p>
<p>On an easy walk at Stronachie, all of our senses were exercised. The air was rich in oxygen from the forest, perfumed with heather; the air crackled as the broom seed pods burst open in the warm late summer sun.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9561.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9561.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Broom seed pods</strong></p>
<p>I changed the lens on the Fuji for the Stronachie walk, having started with the compact and versatile Fuji 35mm f/2, for my Nikon 85mm f/1.4. This is a difficult lens to focus wide open but it makes quite creamy bokeh washes from the background colours, even in low light. </p>

<strong>Plenty of room in the forest</strong> f/1.4 at 1600 ISO</p>
<p>The Nikon lens is well known for its flare, too. This rainbow effect from shooting into the light is caused by internal flare in the lens.</p>

<strong>Rainbow flare</strong></p>
<p>The Fuji X equivalent lens, the 90mm f/2, doesn't have the same flare or bokeh as the much older Nikon. It's not reasonable to compare them, perhaps, because of their age difference. Both are designed as portrait lenses.</p>

<p>On the day of the King's proclamation, and in need of some sea air, we took a run up the coast to Lower Largo. It's been a challenging week for us in one way and another, not least for the depth of emotion we felt at the death of the Queen. There have been other losses, of course, but this one seems to have brought home Joni Mitchell's statement of the obvious: <em>you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone</em>.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9639Panorama.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9639Panorama.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>We walked along the upper path, it being near high tide, to a favourite spot on the beach beside what looks like a rockery arrangement for a garden. The waters swirled around the rocks and the sun passed slowly, ever lower in the sky as autumn progresses, reminding us again of the relentless march of time. Not yet ready to forget the dog days of summer, the sun shone warmly.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9628Panorama.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9628Panorama.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>We sat for a while, the tide shifting the shapes and scenery with sand and seaweed. Sea kayaks passed out in the Forth, with the dead offshore platform Sedco 711 breaking up the horizon. Sunlight sparkled and shimmered on the water as time, <em>ralenti</em>, became all but suspended in the reverie.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9626.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9626.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's nothing like a beach, and no better beach than a Scottish beach, to purge stress and anxiety, those corrosive curses of the contemporary condition. After the passage of some indeterminate time, things are just better than they were; big things smaller; a feeling of coming home settles.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9641.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9641.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As we walked along the path, the soothing splash of the waves on the shore below provided headspace in which to process and park our reflections on the week's events and resolutions were quietly packed in their pockets, ready for when we will need them. </p>

<p>Speaking of Kings, we went for a walk in Pittencrieff Park (known locally as "The Glen"). We were hunting for autumn leaves for an artsy project, specifically Oak. A walk in a park is never a bad idea in my book, and it gave me a chance to re-introduce myself to the big Fuji XF100-400mm zoom lens that I got back from service and repair this week.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9730.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9730.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Dunfermline Abbey</strong></p>
<p>King Charles III recently formally conferred city status on Dunfermline, during his first joint royal visit with the Queen Consort since the death of Queen Elizabeth. The townsfolk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/03/king-charles-confers-city-status-on-dunfermline-scotland">turned out for the occasion</a>, which is nice, even if some were apparently a little unkind to our First Minister. I couldn't possibly comment.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9732.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9732.jpg"/></a>
<strong>The Abbey and Abbey Church</strong> were basking in the early autumn glow. I love how the light played around the buttresses of this old place, which has <a href="https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/dunfermline/abbeypalace/index.html">quite a history</a>. Walking down into the Glen, the colurs in the Japanese Garden were no less magical.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9739.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9739.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Japanese Acer</strong></p>
<p>The contrast was strong as we explored some of the nooks and crannies. Sunlight danced on water and dappled through the leaves, reflecting and re-reflecting greens and reds, oranges and yellows between dark and mysterious Tolkienesque shadows.</p>

<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9763.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9763.jpg"/></a>
What the Americans call <strong>a Sqrl</strong>. There are plenty of these in and around Dunfermline (squirrels, although there are a fair number of Americans, even at this time of year). They have a sense of humour, of course, and will run right across the feet of anyone with a camera just to watch them fumble for focus and fail.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9819.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9819.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Alliums</strong> in the formal garden. We walked here after pausing for a breakfast roll at the Peacock Room, and chatting to an old friend I hadn't seen for 20 years. That was a pleasant surprise and oddly, enabled me to fill in a couple of gaps from a particular period in my life. Nothing major, more an ironing out of wrinkles in a shirt I haven't worn for a while, but a resolution nonetheless.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9861.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9861.jpg"/></a>
<strong>This iconic peacock</strong> is one of a number in the park. There is a new enclosure following the recent mindless attack that resulted in the injury of one bird and the death of another, Malcolm, named for the King whose wife Margaret . More help is needed to support the volunteers who put heart and soul into caring for these beautiful creatures.

<p>After lunch, we had an errand to run in the Lang Toun which gave us an excuse to take another walk, this time around the harbour at Dysart. There is a huge wall there which is home to various pigeons, and tells quite a story of how this place has changed over the years. Part of the cliff at the end of the harbour is no longer safe to walk along but it is easy to access the coastal walk through a short tunnel in the cliff at the end of the wall.</p>

<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9878.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9878.jpg"/></a>

<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9882.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9882.jpg"/></a>

<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF9885.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF9885.jpg"/></a>
Plenty of things to look at in a harbour. There were people working, moving boats, furling sails and so on, and just as many sitting on benches. There were benches everywhere we looked today and I think I like that. Perhaps we are becoming more reflective.</p>

<p>Light leaks and lessons to be learned.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_13092008.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_13092008.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The first roll of photographs in 2021 was also a first time for me shooting Kodak Tri-X 400 film, and also the first roll through the <a href="#cameras-hasselblad-v">Hasselblad 503CW</a> I bought over Christmas. We couldn't go to the Moon to shoot with this iconic camera, so we slogged it to the top of a local hill on a very chilly winter morning. </p>
<p>It was a crampon day, according to a chap we passed on the walk to Glenquey reservoir where our ascent started. He seemed confident enough on the icy path back down so we took it to be banter. As it turned out, we might have benefited from crampons as we took what turned out to be a harder route up the hill. We had poles, and wouldn't have completed the climb without them for sure.</p>
<p>I "stand" processed the film in Rodinal 1:100 for 60 minutes. The film was quite curly when it dried, so I cut it into strips and put it in a book<sup id="fnref:whatbook"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2021-2021-01-04-503cw-first-roll-fn:whatbook">2</a></sup> for half an hour before scanning. Very quickly, as I scanned, a more serious issue presented itself. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_12143206.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_12143206.jpg"/></a>
<strong>The first image</strong> from Innerdownie Hill.</p>
<p>Here, we see a light leak, which comes from the left hand side of the film magazine as seen when shooting. This is disappointing, but I am assured by the very helpful and supportive community of Hasselblad film photographers that this is to be expected when buying an old camera. A proper inspection is required by people experienced in such things, and fortunately, I <a href="https://www.cameratiks.co.uk/repairs">know of such people</a> not far from where I live that can do that. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_12162137.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_12162137.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There is some question about whether I introduced problems during development, but I don't think so, having used this method before without problem. If it had been a development issue, then the banding might have gone the other way (and appeared at the bottom of the frame). I am not confident I can explain the second (central vertical) stripe in the above image. There were two images on the roll with marks like this, and so there may have been something I didn't do quite right in development. Another roll might help confirm this.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_13365007.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_13365007.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The variation in that flare on the right of each frame differs according to the shutter speed used. The longer exposures (such as the 1-second river image below) suffer with a greater effect, whereas in the short exposures (header image, 1/500s at f/22) it is less obvious.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_13514102.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_13514102.jpg"/></a>
<strong>River, from the bridge</strong> 1 second at f/11</p>
<p>Am I disappointed? Well, yes, of course, but perhaps my expectations weren't reasonable. The camera and magazine are just over 20 years old and I have no idea what kind of life they have led. The lens is over 50 years old. It should be expected to have old equipment, used or not, well cared for or not, checked over properly before it functions as it should.</p>
<p>There is some consolation, in that I can recover enough in post processing to render a reasonable image. It's cheating a bit, maybe, but Ansel Adams put a lot of effort into working up his negatives into a decent print. He regarded the negative as the "score" which is interpreted in the "performance" of processing and printing. With that in mind, here is Glendevon from the walk down Innerdownie hill, digitally cropped and processed in Capture One Pro 21:</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_13325578.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/503cw-Kodak-TX400-20210104_13325578.jpg"/></a></p>
<h3 id="stories-2021-2021-01-04-503cw-first-roll-next-steps">Next steps</h3>
<p>The consensus from the Hasselblad Film Photography group on FB is to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... try another roll of film but use conventional agitation with less dilute developer, just to rule that out. If you still have the same problems after that, then you've got a light leak. All the same, light leaks aren't hard or expensive to fix<sup id="fnref:spares"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2021-2021-01-04-503cw-first-roll-fn:spares">1</a></sup>, it's usually a matter of replacing the foam seal around the dark slide, which you can do yourself with nothing more than a set of jeweller's screwdrivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it happens, the seller has offered to have the camera returned for repair. This is the logical next step.</p>
<h3 id="stories-2021-2021-01-04-503cw-first-roll-lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h3>
<dl>
<dt>About the film</dt>
<dd>On reading the <a href="https://imaging.kodakalaris.com/sites/prod/files/files/products/f4017_TriX.pdf">Kodak data sheet</a> for the film stock, I might have over-exposed for the conditions on the hill, which problem may have been masked by stand processing. Most of the snowscape shots were taken at f/11, 1/125s, which is over the suggested f/22, 1/500s for <em>Bright/Hazy Sun on Light Sand or Snow</em>. I used my Nikon FM as a meter on the hill but quite possibly this is an unreliable witness: it had a number 8 yellow filter for which I had compensated 1/3 stop but the TriX data sheet suggests 2 stops for this filter. Next time, I'll use my digital camera for metering.</dd>
<dt>About old cameras</dt>
<dd>It is to be expected that older equipment needs to be maintained and looked after. If buying second hand, assume that inspection and sevice by an experienced technician is needed before you will get the best out of the investment, and budget for it.</dd>
<dt>About stand developing</dt>
<dd>Film manufacturers produce data sheets that are worth following until you have enough experience to vary. There are situations where stand development is a good idea: perhaps where individual frames have been pushed. Reduced grain can be had also, but it doesn't (and shouldn't) compensate for bad focusing.</dd>
<dt>About taking photographs</dt>
<dd>one or two of these images had definitely wonky horizons, and the focus wasn't particularly good. Two basics to work on in 2021.</dd>

<p>Slowly getting my head around analogue photography... a roll of 800 in my old Nikon FM. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_15053096.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_15053096.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Trees at Glendevon in the snow</strong></p>
<p>I recently wrote about a trip to <a href="#stories-2020-2020-11-28-kilminning">Kilminning</a> up the Fife coast and the images I made with a Fuji GW690ii. Well, I also had with me a Nikon FM 35mm camera with some Kodak Portra 800 in it. This is a colour negative film, which cost £12.50 per roll from Analog Wonderland, and was eventually processed by <a href="https://www.ag-photolab.co.uk/">AG Photolab</a> once I'd finished it. I'm not processing my own colour film just yet.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_14310009.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_14310009.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Sunset at Lower Largo</strong>. Obviously right down at f/22 and 1/1000s of a second, but still produced a flare at the top of the image (which I cropped out). Who points a camera at the sun?</p>
<p>What I am finding is that I am preferring medium format for no other reason than it takes <em>forever</em> to finish a roll of 36 frames. If it's a colour film, it can be literally months between closing the shutter and seeing the result, by which time my photography has moved on, or at least, I've forgotten what I was thinking at the time. It's as if I become detached from the image: quite the reverse of my intention in returning to film. Perhaps I ought to up my game a bit: perhaps I'm over diverse. On most of our recent outings, I've had at least three cameras with me. I don't think this is helping me much. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_15094070.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_15094070.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Lower Largo</strong>. I like the sky.</p>
<p>Accurate metering still evades me, but I feel I am getting a clearer understanding of this: I've started Ansel Adams' <em>The Negative</em> in which he describes his <em>Zone System</em> for proper evaluation of a frame. With some understanding of this, maybe I'll be less reliant on the "magic" of my phone's app, or the little red LEDs in my Nikon, which rarely agree on what the correct exposure settings are.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_15155136.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_15155136.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Castle Hill reservoir</strong></p>
<p>The Portra emulsions have a characteristic colour palette that I like. It's almost pastel: I think it's probably more suited to brighter light than I have exposed it in this roll, which are mostly wintery scenes, most recently taken on a walk out at Glenquey reservoir. The top image, of trees at Glendevon in the snow, gains very little from the colours of Portra, for example.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_15195895.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_15195895.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Bridge at Glendevon</strong>. White balance adjusted from the scanner's default in Capture One. A bit more Portra-like, in my view.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this workflow that is bothering me is what the scanner assumes in the process. The colours and contrast often seem unimpressive. I can't tell if it's me or the device: I'm assuming it's me at the moment, because I want to not overdo the post-processing. Here's one that I adjusted white balance, a little clarity, and added just a touch of sharpening to. I quite like it.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_15350082.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/FM-Kodak-Portra-800-20210110_15350082.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Glendevon</strong></p>
<p>The whole point of analogue photography is that you fiddle as little as possible in the digital space. That sounds like something that should be on a T-shirt.</p>

<p>Early experience with Kodak's vintage emulsion in a Nikon FM and an Agfa Isolette medium format folder. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/FM-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_08420161.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/FM-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_08420161.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Kodak Tri-X has been around since World War II and has earned a reputation for being flexible in all kinds of applications. I bought some 135 and 120 from <a href="https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/">Analog Wonderland</a> for £7 and £8 per roll, respectively. The first roll went through my <a href="#stories-2021-2021-01-04-503cw-first-roll">Hassleblad</a> with not too much success and I promised then not to stand develop this film next time.</p>
<p>Well, that's all well and good but the exposures I made with both my Nikon FM and the Agfa Isolette were "empirical" and in variable light. Because of this, I <a href="#exposures-2020-2020-07-12-bergger-panchro-400">semi-stand developed</a> these in the hope that the development principle of this method might compensate for variable metering.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/FM-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_08480811.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/FM-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_08480811.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Innerdownie Hill</strong>, Nikon FM. Compare with the <a href="#stories-2021-2021-01-04-503cw-first-roll">similar image taken on my Hasselblad</a>.</p>
<p>The first few frames of the roll taken in the Nikon FM were exposed up Innerdownie Hill. I had a No. 8 Yellow filter that ought to have about 2 stops of compensation applied to it, but I stupidly adjusted the ISO on the camera's meter. Think about it -- this camera has TTL or through-the lens metering. That means that the meter reads the light inside the camera <em>after</em> it has passed through the filter. It already compensates for the filter's attenuation, so you don't have to. This is one reason why semi-stand development was used for this film: I realised I had blundered on the metering.</p>

<p>I've learned not to take myself too seriously as a photographer. There are many, many better photographers than me, so I don't get the rage when things don't work out, except at myself when I continually fail to learn a lesson. Occasionally, though, I'll try something I haven't before, and the top image shows an attempt at "ICM", or intentional camera movement. This has been used by some artists to convey emotion or a feeling, and I think my version has a sense of what it felt like to be in the woods on that snowy day. I'm pleased with it, anyway: it was consciously done, knowing that it was too dark for a hand-held capture, and that the mossy mound I had chosen for a makeshift tripod was just too mossy to be useful, it was a case of either not taking the photo, or pausing for a moment to connect to the feeling of it. I thought ICM might do it: I think it it did.</p>

<p>I scanned these after developing and then pulled them into Capture One for adjustment. Cropping and rotation are first, usually. Cropping, because the negative carrier Epson supplies with the scanner is pretty flimsy and difficult to use. Rotation is often required because I am rubbish at keeping a horizon level (ask anyone who flew with me in the days I had a pilot's licence). Adjustment is necessary beyond this, because I didn't let the scanner do anything by way of exposure adjustment or colour rendering -- I am hoping that it just scans the negatives into a file containing all of the information in the film and doesn't try to do any thinking for me.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Agfa-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_13170035.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Agfa-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_13170035.jpg"/></a>
<em>Loch Leven</em></p>
<p>Other adjustments in Capture One include the standard set of looking at the levels and mid-tone contrast, and maybe removing dust specks (I'm not at the white cotton-glove stage of handling my negatives). Here is where I notice persistent problems: in the Nikon, I am noticing metering inconsistencies, or at least errors with extended use in cold weather. Perhaps I have relied heavily on the meter inside this camera too much, which has resulted in some disappointments, this roll included, when ambient light levels are low. If I'm going to have to work in digital post-processing, I might as well shoot digital in the first place.</p>

<em>Loch Lurg</em></p>
<p>Some time later, we were down at Pettycur beach for sunset, which came around the same time as high tide. The Isolette came out this time for a few frames, and the Nikon was on a tripod. The final outing to finish the film was back up a local hill for some exercise away from other people. Off the road, we saw nobody that wasn't on some distant hill.</p>

<p>Playing with 35mm film in a Medium-format camera. 
<a class="glightbox" href="/img/Agfa-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_11242766.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Agfa-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_11242766.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fukukawatakashi/">Fukukawatakashi</a>'s work making triptychs and thought I might play around with the idea. First time out, I used a roll of Rollei Blackbird, which is rated at 64 ISO but seems to be quite <em>laissez-faire</em> about how you shoot it. I put it in my Agfa Isolette medium-format camera, which also seems to be quite laid back in respect of how long a film you put through it. No frame counters to get in the way of the abuse I was planning. </p>
<p>A couple of 3D printed plastic adaptors<sup id="fnref:eBay"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2021-2021-01-18-rollei-blackbird-fn:eBay">1</a></sup> allow you to fit a standard 135 film canister into the supply reel of the camera. I fed it onto the take-up spool and had counted on 2 and one third half-turns to be about enough for a 6cm wide image, which is what the camera is designed for. That only worked at the end of the roll<sup id="fnref:idiot"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2021-2021-01-18-rollei-blackbird-fn:idiot">2</a></sup>: the early images needed a bit more, and so ended up overlapping:</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Agfa-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_11242766 1.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Agfa-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_11242766 1.jpg"/></a>
<em>Frames 11 -- 16</em></p>
<p>A crop from this image is in the header. Notice another small problem above, in the second frame from the left. Some of the images show a little crescent-shaped mark. 120 film has backing paper to protect the emulsion from this exposure: 135 does not, and so some of the images were spoiled from where I had (from habit) opened the window in the back of the camera to peek at the exposure counter, or from light leaks there. Next time I try this, maybe I'll duct tape it.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Agfa-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_12264437.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Agfa-Kodak-400-TX-20210118_12264437.jpg"/></a>
<em>Frames 30 -- 31</em></p>
<p>This image (Frames 30 -- 31, above) gave away an issue that I think I've had with some of the images I've developed at home: streaks in the negative that can only have been introduced in the chemical processing. These look clearly to me like marks made by a fluid: the film perforations have been part of a disturbance in the fluid that has caused uneven development in the emulsion. I wonder, also, about the agitation of the film in the tank. This batch was two 135 films in the same tank, and I chose to use an inversion rather than using the swizzle stick in the Paterson tank. I think I need to read more about the whole process in order to understand what's going on (and to do it better).</p>

<em>Three rocks triptych</em></p>
<p>Fukukawatakashi need not worry I'm going to steal his thunder any time soon but I'm thankful to him (and most of the community of great photographers out there at the moment) for sharing their work and ideas. Through trying this one, I discovered more about what I still have to learn on this journey, and that's a good thing.</p>

<p>Of course, if you do a little geometry, it makes sense that early in the roll, it takes more turns to move on a single frame, because there is less film on the take up spool. As film moves onto this spool, the radius increases and fewer rotations are needed to advance the film 6cm.

<p>I love this film stock -- relatively cheap at a fiver a roll from <a href="https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/">Analogue Wonderland</a> and very forgiving. This roll, I "semi-stand" developed in a highly dilute solution of 3 cm<sup>3</sup> of Rodinal R09 in half a litre of water. The camera for this roll was  Fuji GW690ii medium-format monster that shoots only 8 images per roll, each 6cm by 9cm wide. Scanned at 6400 dpi, that makes for over 300 Mega pixels. Not that anyone shooting film gives a monkey's toss for pixel-peeping. I'm probably overdoing it by scanning at 6400 dpi, to be honest.</p>
<p>We took this beast of a camera up a local hill to catch the twilight at a favourite exercise spot of ours. We like the place because there are very few people there, so we can be socially responsible, get some fresh air and exercise, and take a few photographs.</p>

<em>Common Hill</em></p>
<p>Some of the frames in this film displayed the "streaks" I've been experiencing lately in all of my cameras and different film stock (you can see one in the image below). The common factor is the stand- or semi-stand development technique I have been using at home. Best advice from the old forums is that it's a bad idea without a specific reason to use it, and that it is problematic: streaks are common, especially in 35mm film which has sprocket holes. It is suggested that Rodinal at 1:100 is fully exhausted after about 20 minutes, so longer than that is pointless, and that 5 minutes is the maximum time that should elapse between agitations under development.</p>

<p>Not all of the images were streaky, however, and so the roll wasn't a complete loss. More lessons learned.</p>

<p>A few days in the North West</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF8005.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF8005.jpg"/></a>
<em>Thistles. Fuji X-T2</em></p>
<p>For our summer trip North this year, I took the Hasselblad 503CW and my Nikon FM with digital backup from a Ricoh GRIII and my Fuji X-T2. The Agfa stayed in the bag and the GW690ii stayed at home. There's only so much gear one can carry.</p>
<p>One of the first beaches we headed for was Acheninver, a short walk from the hostel where we spent the first couple of nights. It was overcast for the first few days of our break, which was a blessing for us because the mobs were elsewhere. At the beach was a man filling builder's bags with seaweed: curious, I asked him why. Crofter Steve Husband explained that there is a <a href="https://www.islemartin.org/isle-martin-seaweed-festival-home/">seaweed festival</a> on Isle Martin in September and that a dry run of glassmaking had used the entire stock of seaweed, so he was replenishing. The seaweed is dried and burned with sand to make artisan glass, and burning kelp is an ancient tradition in the North. Some of the seaweed Steve had gathered looked good enough to eat, and indeed, it can be used for culinary purposes.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF7975.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF7975.jpg"/></a>
<em>Steve in his tractor with his Gaelic-speaking dog. Fuji X-T2</em></p>
<p>The next day, we tried out a new camping stove on Achmelvich beach, pushing the culinary boundaries by heating up a tin of sausages and beans. Classy. On our meander around the Coigach and Drumbeg, I tried a bit of sketching. Some way to go, I think.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/IMG_9378.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/IMG_9378.jpg"/></a>
<em>Achnahaird beach, sketch</em></p>
<p>The last few days were spent in Drumbeg House, or at least, in a self-contained house within the grounds of said House. This was a perfectly peaceful place to escape for a few days with its own cairn at the side of its own loch and a decent deer population to get us close to that Highland feeling.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF8099.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF8099.jpg"/></a>
<em>Young stag. Fuji X-T2</em></p>
<p>We were treated to a close encounter with one of these stags, at the point we were ready to give up hope of seeing the wildlife without a telephoto lens, when one wandered through the bracken and paused on the grass between the house and the loch, to gaze at us, neither of us knowing whether to grab a camera or just experience the moment.</p>

<p>The old house has been renovated, we think under new ownership, perhaps to return to its former glory as an exclusive dining experience for those who do that kind of thing. Traces of a more private small estate are still seen in the grounds.</p>

<em>Kinghorn beach, Fife</em> Hasselblad, E100</p>
<p>I sort of lost track of photography in the first part of this year, not least film photography. There were 3 120 films kicking about for a while, which I eventually sent to AG on 3rd April 2021 for developing and scanning. The negatives came back all square, with telltale Hasselblad notches that told me they were taken in my 503CW.</p>

<p>I hadn't been in the habit of recording exposure details this year, either, so there's a bit of guesswork in identifying the subject of the images. From a digital note on my phone:</p>
<p>TMY BW - From the Agfa?<br/>
Portra 160 maybe Hasselblad<br/>
E100 — Hasselblad on Kinghorn / Burntisland beach 3 April</p>
<p>Possibly — Hasselblad Portra Crail<br/>
1 rock at f/16 about 1/8s<br/>
2 same Lee 10 stop 2 1/2 min inc 30 sec for rf  </p>
<p>Scanned results were disappointing: dust on the BW, dust and only 11 frames on the Portra, and bands/rainbow stripes on the E100. AG said the dust wasn’t their problem, nor was the fact that I thought I had ordered TIFFs and received jpegs. I certainly won’t be using them again for this service, which was 35 quid on top of processing. They did offer to rescan the slides.</p>
<p>I bought some <em>Digitaliza</em> negative holders from Lomography over the summer and tried them rescanning some of these images. I had to fight a bit with the Epson website to download the driver for the MacBook Air I am using, which runs macOS Big Sur 11.4 but the first scan out at 600 dpi wasn't bad, and was certainly better than the scans I had from AG.</p>
<p>The next strip -- the Digitaliza does a whole strip at a time -- was from the Portra and was also OK. This image was an experiment with the super-dark Lee neutral density filter and a long exposure. It's OK, and proves it can be done but it seems tasteless to me, to use film this way. I probably won't do it again.</p>

<em>Crail beach. Hasselblad 503CW with Lee Big Stopper</em></p>
<p>The last strip was of Kodak Ektachrome E100, for which I switched the scanner's colour management off. These were very nice indeed, with just a trace of banding visible in the sky on a sunny walk on Kinghorn beach (see header image).</p>

<em>Kinghorn Beach. Hasselblad 503CW hand held</em></p>
<p>One thing I am sure of, is that I don't look after my film stock particularly well: it goes nowhere near a fridge, spending much of its life bashing around in a tin box in the boot of my car. I'm going to try to do something about that, maybe, before getting stressed out about the banding here: I did better than a professional scanning service.</p></section><section class="print-page" id="stories-2021-2021-07-30-five-films"><h1 id="stories-2021-2021-07-30-five-films-five-films">Five films</h1>

<p>Continuing the series of films I had lost track of this year, there were another five exposed films kicking about with only partial notes and recall to record them. Again, using my new Digitaliza film holders and a new MacBook Air, the scans were interesting. In this series:</p>

<h2 id="stories-2021-2021-07-30-five-films-ektachrome">Ektachrome</h2>
<p>I am becoming a big fan of Kodak's modern slide film: no big surprise, really, because years ago I favoured Kodachrome and Agfa's transparency film in my Nikon FM. Here, a few frames in the huge Fuji GW690ii 6 x 9 camera taken around Kilconquhar and St Monans around 9th April. Scanned at 3200 dpi, the digital images are about 80 mega pixels in size, although sharpness doesn't satisfy the pixel-neurotic: it's colours that make these images worth making.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Ektachrome-E100-20210730_20292470.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Ektachrome-E100-20210730_20292470.jpg"/></a>
<em>Church at Kilconquhar. Fuji GW690ii, Ektachrome E100</em></p>
<p>The composition here isn't perfect: it was tempting to crop out the part-of-a-treee on the left of this picture but there is something in me that wants to crop and adjust as little as possible.  I can see what I was thinking with the line of the path central to the composition and am pleased that I kept these parallel to the lines of the church tower. There's always a bit of difference between what you see in the rangefinder window and the image on the film so I consider this a successful image.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Ektachrome-E100-20210730_20370722.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Ektachrome-E100-20210730_20370722.jpg"/></a>
<em>Kilconquhar. Fuji GW690ii, Ektachrome E100</em></p>
<p>I like the colours in this image taken at the loch, facing in the other direction, a few paces from where I captured the church. The complementary sky and grass tones here work for me. What is most impressive with this film stock is that there is almost no post processing required -- the header sunset image taken in February at Pattiesmuir shows this, I think, as well as these snaps from Kilconquhar and St. Monans. Sunlight and good skies are a real bonus too.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Ektachrome-E100-20210730_20451049.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Ektachrome-E100-20210730_20451049.jpg"/></a>
<em>St. Monan's harbour. Fuji GW690ii, Ektachrome E100</em></p>
<p>Taken from the walk down to the famous wonky sea wall at St. Monans, this again might have been cropped on the left if it had been a digital capture. I love the two-weather sky here.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2021-2021-07-30-five-films-cinestill-800t">Cinestill 800T</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Cinestill-800T-20210731_18185960.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Cinestill-800T-20210731_18185960.jpg"/></a>
<em>Flowers at Dumbarnie Links, Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T</em></p>
<p>Cinestill 800T is a fast popular film stock, with the "T" indicating that it is designed to be used in tungsten light. It's ideal for shooting urban scenes at night, which was my intention when I bought a few rolls of 135 and 120 at the beginning of 2021. This first roll was exposed in April in a Nikon FM in daylight at Seafield Beach, Dumbarnie Links (frames 16--25) and Elie (frames 26ff). Scanning as before, I processed them in Capture One, severely adjusting white balance and contrast to compensate for the blue shift of the abused film.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Cinestill-800T-20210731_18112996.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Cinestill-800T-20210731_18112996.jpg"/></a>
<em>Seafield Beach. Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T</em></p>
<p>This seemed to do the trick, rendering colours realistically with only two slider adjustments off the scanner. I'm learning to not allow the scanner to do anything with the colour of the files it creates. The above image of flowers at Dumbarnie Links illustrates this.</p>
<p>I'm generally pleased with the results if not a little <em>meh</em> about my collection of dead boring images. Cinestill 800T is an exciting film to use for exciting images: punchy urban scenes evocative of some other era or dark filmic concepts. It's not really meant for landscapes taken on walks, the purpose of which was not photography but clearing heads. I hope my next set of images with this film stock will do it better justice.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Cinestill-800T-20210731_18550535.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Cinestill-800T-20210731_18550535.jpg"/></a>
<em>Elie Beach. Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T</em></p>
<p>I do like the rendering of contrast and tone in this film, once adjusted. Below, Lady's Tower on a sunny day in Fife gives the film a chance to show this to create a nice image that evokes the feeling of the moment it was captured. More than that, I guess, can't be asked for.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Cinestill-800T-20210731_19054350.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Cinestill-800T-20210731_19054350.jpg"/></a>

<em>St. Monans, Fife. Hasselblad 503CW, 80mm Zeiss.</em></p>
<p>This film stock was introduced in 2019 as a new film emulsion with extended range, meaning that the sensitivity is stated on the box as ISO 100 -- 400 and you take your pick. I exposed this roll at the higher speed to see how it worked there. As with all of the films in this mini-series, I got AG Photographic to develop them for me.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Lomochrome-Metropolis-EI400-20210801_13364835.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Lomochrome-Metropolis-EI400-20210801_13364835.jpg"/></a>
<em>Bass Rock from Crail. Hasselblad 503CW, 80mm Zeiss.</em></p>
<p>I first scanned this roll using 48-bit colour and 6400 dpi settings which produced square image files post-processing of about 180 megapixels. The colours are muted and cool. It took some time to find the correct white balance adjustment in Capture One but I think the image of St Monans church in Fife is a fair rendition of the film's character. I like that the contrast is strong. You will not see the Hasselblad notches in that image because, as with many of my hand-held photographs, the horizon was a bit squint, as they say around here, so I had to adjust it and crop.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Lomochrome-Metropolis-EI400-20210801_13364835-1.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Lomochrome-Metropolis-EI400-20210801_13364835-1.jpg"/></a>
<em>Crail, Fife. Hasselblad 503CW, 80mm Zeiss.</em></p>
<p>This was the last useful frame off the roll, as some time later, during a visit to the Hermitage at Dunkeld, I reached for the Hasselblad and forgot there was film in it. Sheer stupidity caused me to open the film back to load a new film without first checking the clever mechanical indicator on the cartridge. I'm going to say that I will not do that again but then again I also say that my next car will be a Maserati.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2021-2021-07-30-five-films-ilford-delta-3200">Ilford Delta 3200</h2>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20210801_17251720-1.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20210801_17251720-1.jpg"/></a>
<em>St.Monans Harbour. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS</em></p>
<p>As this is a black and white film, I might have developed this myself but as with all of the films in this mini-series, I got AG Photographic to develop it for me. It was scanned at 6400, then 3200 dpi in 24-bit colour (otherwise the scanner screws up the colour profile in the output file). In post-processing, the profile is switched to black and white. The early images were not of good enough resolution to justify 6400 dpi, hence the switch to something lower.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20210801_16112152.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20210801_16112152.jpg"/></a>
<em>Edinburgh, from Fife. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS</em></p>
<p>Most of those early frames were quite disappointing, being underexposed and losing detail in the shadows. I'm fairly sure this was a metering issue: I rely on the built-in LED through-the-lens metering when shooting with the Nikon FM and this might be the price of laziness. Some can be recovered, though, and this image shows a sort of moody shoreline to illustrate the point.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20210801_17025154.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20210801_17025154.jpg"/></a>
<em>Edinburgh. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS</em></p>
<p>This is the view from my office window on the Holyrood campus. Delta 3200 might suggest a good low-light film but I think it's more fast than it is good in the dark. It needs light to function properly. The next image also, perhaps, is more suited to the grainy emulsion of Delta 3200.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20210801_17174590.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20210801_17174590.jpg"/></a>
<em>The Palace, Rosyth. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS</em></p>
<p>Something more urban in flavour demands not only monochrome but also the character of a grainy film stock like this. I don't think it handles wide dynamic range the way I had hoped, however. Shooting into the light is probably not the best idea:</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20210801_17251720.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20210801_17251720.jpg"/></a>
<em>Harbour Bell, St.Monans. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS</em></p>
<p>Delta 3200 can perform well with good light, and yield decent contrasty images if you meter and expose correctly. </p>

<em>Queensferry Crossing from St. Margaret's Marsh</em></p>
<p>I scanned most of these at 3200 or 4800 dpi in 48-bit colour with the scanner's colour handling switch off. The first few frames were taken at the Hermitage, near Dunkeld, during a weekend run up to one of our favourite places in May. We needed reflection time and the COVID restrictions were just so that we could do the right thing as we did The Right Thing for us.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Portra-160-20210808_18071280.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Portra-160-20210808_18071280.jpg"/></a>
<em>Ossian's Hall. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS</em></p>
<p>The Dunkeld weekend was not in the brightest of sunshine and that tends to wash out the colours in Portra, I think. This is a dark and moody kind of place when it's overcast, so the image above does portray that. No marks for composition -- there's a better portrait version but that favours the bridge over the hall and I wanted to show that in this post.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Portra-160-20210808_18071280-1.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Portra-160-20210808_18071280-1.jpg"/></a>
<em>Queensferry Crossing from St. Margaret's Marsh</em></p>
<p>There was better light when we walked on the Forth Shore at St. Margaret's Marsh, between the bridges and the dockyard. Some while later, we were at Loch Lubnaig where the colours of the greenery dominate the images taken with this film.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Portra-160-20210808_18365655.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Portra-160-20210808_18365655.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm not such a fan of 160 in anything other than really good daylight. Composition plays a part, too, and these images aren't my best: the last few frames of the roll were taken at Burntisland.</p>

<p>Remembering 9/11 20 years on</p>

<em>Above Polney Loch</em>, Ricoh GRIII</p>
<p>We needed an escape from the madness and so jumped in the car and headed North to Tiso, the M&amp;S Foodstore and on to Dunkeld by way of the new road which is very nice, I have to say. The motive was almost a visceral need to be in the woods, and this time of year is when that experience is at its best as the colours are changing as fast as the air does: from the mouthfuls of balmy summer warmth to shorter bites of soupy vapour returned to the atmosphere as evanescent clouds. Mushroom time.</p>

<em>Fungus abounds. f/8 1/2s</em></p>
<p>I took a Hasselblad 503CW with a roll of Kodak Tri-X, and a Ricoh GRIII in my pocket for the more immediate gratification of having something to show on the day for our efforts. On this day, without explicitly talking about it, we remembered the events of 20 years ago with humility and gratitude, within one of Nature's Cathedrals.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_14291790.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_14291790.jpg"/></a>
<em>Bark on various trees. f/2.8 1/2s</em></p>
<p>In the peace and reflection of our walk, I noticed the bark patterns on the aged trees, like the scars of experience, each different from the others, each with their own stories to tell. These patterns became as faces of old men and women, taciturn yet expressive of triumph and loss, of lessons learned and not, of survival and the remembrance of those who did not.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_14325659.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_14325659.jpg"/></a>
<em>Bark on various trees. f/2.8 1/4s</em></p>
<p>These were taken quite near the Cally car park where we began our stroll and I recall the steps, the birdsong and the additional aroma of the sawmill below the path, as I write this in October. A month from now is another great remembrance when I celebrate getting older, living vicariously for those who have been denied.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_14364914.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_14364914.jpg"/></a>
<em>Bark on various trees. f/2.8 1/30s</em></p>
<p>The leaves on the birch trees on the far bank were turning a light golden yellow, which in this black and white image, is reminiscent of infra-red photographs I have taken. Not in this case; just gorgeous tones against the evergreen backdrop.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_15193092.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_15193092.jpg"/></a>
<em>Polney Loch</em></p>
<p>At the end of the loch stands this wooden lodge -- a fisherman's howff, perhaps -- that looks like it is from another age. It isn't that old by the looks of it but we might easily be convinced that we stepped through a portal back there.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_15072703.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_15072703.jpg"/></a>
<em>House at the end of the Loch</em></p>
<p>A detail of a hatch or door to the lodge reveals some old-time traditional craftsmanship, like you'd find on any great country estate. And ferns.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_15024288.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Tri-X-400-20211010_15024288.jpg"/></a>
<em>Door detail</em></p>
<p>I developed the film a couple of weeks later in Rodinal R09 using about 50:1 over 20 minutes with some agitation. I'm reasonably happy with the results but have to ask myself if the effort involved in getting these images out of an old Hasselblad is really that much superior to the almost instantaneous and high quality of the Ricoh. If it had been just the Ricoh that day, this whole story and reflection might have been consigned to history in a single, fleeting Instagram post. Perhaps it's nothing to do with the camera.</p>

<strong>Sanna Bay, the small isles</strong> Fuji X-T2 XF16mm ISO800 f/16 at 1/125s</p>
<p>We took a trip to the Ardnamurchan peninsula for our anniversary and enjoyed the pleasures of that with some photography. The sun shone on the first day, and took a jigsaw puzzle day on the second, giving us time for proper rest and relaxation. We stayed at Ard Daraich, home of the artist <a href="https://arddaraich.co.uk/anna-raven-artist/">Anna Raven</a> and her husband, film-maker <a href="https://ardgour-selfcatering.co.uk/norrie-maclaren/">Norrie MacLaren</a>. The house and gardens are <a href="https://www.countrylife.co.uk/gardens/country-gardens-and-gardening-tips/ard-daraich-was-the-holiday-home-of-constance-spry-155070">well known</a> as the former home of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Spry">Constance Spry</a>, famed as the creator of Coronation Chicken for the Queen. Our accommodation was the <a href="https://ardgour-selfcatering.co.uk/accommodation/the-garden-studio/">Garden Studio</a>, former garage to the larger house and nestled between the house and Anna's studio which houses a substantial printing press which she uses to create some of her work. </p>
<p>On this trip I finished a roll of Portra 160 in a Hasselblad 503CW and Kodak 400 Tri-X in the amazing little Agfa Isolette. The exposures in those two rolls are included further below.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/R0001106.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/R0001106.jpg"/></a>
<em>Bridge over the river Gour, Ricoh GRiii</em></p>
<p>The house sits on a lane that leads to <a href="https://www.ardgourholidays.co.uk/ardgour-house-">Ardgour House</a>, an altogether grander holiday destination, beyond our means and expectations. The lane passes over the river Gour by way of this bridge, which lit up in the unexpected sunshine of our first day, throwing reflections and patterns from the cool waters.</p>

<em>Reflection 4, Fuji X-T2</em></p>
<p>In the other direction, the lane ends at Loch Linnhe, which like all of Highland Scotland is alive with russets, rubies, rusty maroons, cardinals, carmines and ambers. The beach is striped with sea salad, echoing the leaves on the trees in heralding the fall of summer's gaudy sparkle.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/R0001110.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/R0001110.jpg"/></a>
<em>Beach salad, Ricoh GR-III</em></p>
<p>Our too-short sojourn at Ard Daraich was surely a rehearsal for a return to Ardgour and the stunning Ardnamurchan peninsula. A restful reconnaissance, well-earned and thoroughly appreciated as other duties call us back to the routine rumpus of that which pays us. We will be mellow, perhaps, as we savour the memories of the recent weekend.</p>
<!-- These are some of the digital images captured on the trip, but I also carried film cameras (Hasselblad and Agfa) with me and will be posting more from those and the trip home through Glen Coe and Glen Etive soon. -->

<p>I feel I have to show you some comparatives, starting with this image. Compare it with the first image in this post.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Portra-160-503CW-20220306_17083822.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Portra-160-503CW-20220306_17083822.jpg"/></a></p>

<em>Beach salad, Hasselblad 503CW</em></p>
<p>This image is quite different from the russet reds of the digital capture I made at the same time: here, no adjustments were made after scanning other than a slight crop adjustment. I think it's just as strong in rendering the emotion of the moment. You can almost smell it. This is my favourite image from the roll and one I might print.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Kodak-Portra-160-503CW-20220306_17400952.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Kodak-Portra-160-503CW-20220306_17400952.jpg"/></a>
<em>The Frandy Tree, Glendevon, Hasselblad 503CW</em></p>
<p>This is a famous tree to those who walk near Glendevon, as we did shortly after we got home. We know it as the Frandy Tree, named for the nearby fishery. It stands alone at the foot of Common Hill and strikes one of those poses that looks different at different times and seasons but also from different directions.</p>
<p>You can see some of the digital images captured on the trip are in the <a href="#2021-10-18-ard-daraich">previous post</a>, but I also carried my Agfa and will be posting images from that when I can.</p>

<p>I exposed several rolls of 120 film in my Fuji GW690 "Texas Leica" during a trip to the Faroe Islands in February 2020. The camera has a fixed 90mm f/3.5 lens and takes 6 cm x 9 cm frames, or 8 per roll of 120. I sent them all to be processed by AG Labs.</p>

<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-lrps">LRPS</h3>
<p>Well, the good news came by email around 12:40 from Simon Vercoe, the LRPS admin assistant at the Royal Photographic Society, that I am finally to be awarded the distinction of "Licentiate" of the RPS. I'm delighted about that, of course. More on that story <a href="#stories-2020-02-06-lrps">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-travelling-by-plane-with-film">Travelling by plane with film</h3>
<p>We are on board a flight from Edinburgh to Vágar, the capital of the Faroe Islands. I have my Fuji GW690ii medium format camera with me and a stock of 9 film rolls that hopefully haven't been ruined by the airport security scan at Edinburgh. Despite my protests, the security people scanned all of the unexposed film. We'll see if there is any effect on the stock<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-fn:1">2</a></sup>. I think the greatest danger to the film still lies in my photographic skills. </p>

<p>Not Scotland, not Thailand, but with some characteristics of both. The first film I loaded into the camera was one of the rolls of Kodak TMY, aka T-Max 400 and fitted a deep yellow Tiffen filter. Why that one? It's the one I have. Why a filter? We're going to be focusing on landscapes and I want to try not to wreck the skies: the yellow will darken the bluer highlights in the sky and reveal the cloud texture. You can see how this turned out in the above image which was taken later that morning. As it turned out, this was the only roll of this film stock that saw the light of day on this trip<sup id="fnref:fw"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-fn:fw">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-mivagur">Miðvágur</h3>
<p>A good sleep. waking early to a still, deep darkness. Aurora Watch says we ought to be able to see some action but the 8 okta cloud cover says otherwise. Coffee, fruit and biscuits to wake us up instead. Once the daylight appeared we got to see and appreciate the view from the house.</p>

<p>The delightful little village at Bøur has some great views, including the Draganir Sea Stacks, an iconic feature of the Faroes. All around the islands and in these communities are signs reminding visitors of the importance of respect for the environment, the creatures that live here and the people. One of the striking features of this place is the black sand beach.</p>

<p>My first efforts with Portra. I think we might have been too far North for this film, which seems to be more at home nearer the Equator. I exposed this film during the rest of day 2 and the following morning. If you think I didn't take many photos, remember I was also carrying a couple of digital cameras, something I don't do as much now.</p>

<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-digital-backup">Digital backup</h3>
<p>I finished that roll of TMY at Bøur on the beach, and backed up the captures using the Ricoh GRIII I carry everywhere, and my Fuji X-T2 fitted with the brilliant Fuji 16mm f/1.4 prime lens. I wondered whether the sun was too low in the sky for the Portra film (Miami, this ain't) but the film worked out really nicely, in my view. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Gasadalur.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Gasadalur.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Gasadalur</strong></p>
<p>The best image of the day has been a 3-photo stitch of the village Gasadalur from the bench at a hairpin bend in the road looking west towards the helipad that was the only outside communication link for the community before the road was built. This is a 3-image stitch panorama taken with a Fuji X-T2, using the XF16mm F1.4 R WR lens. ISO 400, f/11, 1/60s.</p>
<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-later-re-scanning">Later - re-scanning</h3>
<p>I re-scanned a couple of these images to see if the output quality was any better. It is, depending on how you measure it. This is a (reduced version of the scanner output) 350 Mega-pixel file, scanned from  6x9cm negative at 6400 dpi:</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/img20200719_09.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/img20200719_09.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Island</strong> (Re-scan of frame 5, Portra)</p>
<p>If you compare the quality of image I got with the Fuji X-T2 (Gasadalur, above), there really is no argument for film photography, based upon these results. Now, I know that medium format cameras capture a lot of information, but that depends on a lot of things being exactly right. Get more than a couple of parameters sub-optimal and you're wasting your time striving for that Nirvana of image-making. To me, the important difference is how it feels.</p>

<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-reflections">Reflections</h3>
<p>Studying the local guide map over coffee and a biscuit, I realise how ignorant I feel about the place and culture I am in. This, as a consequence of the pace of life I am leading, ironically to pay for the privilege of travel. I will no doubt go home full of resolutions to do something about this, which will be dragged into the quicksand of daily hustle and bustle, leaving only the guilt as trace that I ever made them.</p>
<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-sandavagur_1">Sandavágur</h3>
<p>We drove down to Sandavágur for the sunrise, which was wintery. Kara played with waves and the seals and I took a photo of the floodlit church which didn't turn out the way I hoped. This is the church, taken the next day with Fuji Pro 400H.</p>

<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-torshavn">Tórshavn</h3>
<p>After a good breakfast we headed for the Streymoy tunnel and Tórshavn, where we ate extremely expensive sushi. One of the delights of the Faroes is that they have not learned how to do tourism yet, with its expected levels of service. Certainly our waitress hadn't done the course. I'm not complaining - it's nice to have the feeling that you're not just following in the footsteps of 80 million people before you, taking the same photos. I didn't take many photos in the town: it's nice, and there is a harbour and some old buildings but it was raining and I was happy just experiencing the place.</p>
<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-fuji-pro-400h-exposures">Fuji Pro 400H exposures</h3>
<p>I used 2 rolls of Fuji Pro 400H in different contexts: starting with the Trøllkonufingur, the town of Tórshavn, and at Gasadalur, the iconic lake over the sea.</p>

<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-bsdalafossur">Bøsdalafossur</h3>
<p>We went out for sunrise at the Witch's Finger (Trøllkonufingur) which was unspectacular due to clouds obstructing the sun but still fun. After breakfast, we headed out to find the lake above the sea. We did, but not before shelling out 200 Króna each for the privilege of access to the footways. A nicely spoken local girl was manning the barricade and promising tea and coffee when we returned from our hike. </p>

<p>Of course, she wasn't there when we returned after sunset. We didn't care much, having had around 10km and 120m of elevation to stretch our muscles on. Leitisvatn / Sørvágsvatn lake ("the lake above the sea") pours over the Bøsdalafossur waterfall 30 metres into the sea below, which crashes dramatically against the cliff edges as if it were trying to get back up into the peaceful waters of the lake, where people were kayaking when we were there.</p>

<p>The cliffs on the walk to the lake are several hundred metres above the sea and even on a fairly calm day, as today was, the thought of a sudden gust or a seagull with a sense of humour kept us focused and not too close to the edge. We met a local near the top of the walk who chatted in good English about the Scottish fishermen who threw chocolate to the local kids, who in turn sold lighters to the fishermen. My wife's grandfather was one of those fishermen.</p>

<p>We passed this little shed-cum-cottage several times as we explored the area around Miðvágur. I had to stop to capture this scene with the Fuji Pro film I was carrying. I love the colours and would love to come back to see it again in the summer light.</p>

<p>We found this artsy sculpture near the roadside that runs by Lake Sørvágsvatn. It represents a Nykur, a mythical Scandinavian creature that drags children down to the bottom of the icy waters. Saying the name of the creature makes it lose all of its powers. I wonder if someone said the name of the sculptor.</p>

<p>First time out with Acros was in the early morning as the sun came up over the Trøllkonufingur. In retrospect, this is probably not the best situation to use this legendary contrasty film. The results were not stunning, in my view, and certainly not as good as I expected, but that's operator error and not a problem with the film stock. Notice the first few exposures are all long, but get less long as the Northern winter light improved.</p>

<p>Same applies to this film as the Acros. I'm not giving up on it, because I've seen good results elsewhere but I'm not sufficiently expert to get the most out of orthographic film yet. This point is emphasised by the fact that I left the lens cap on for frames 2 and 3. My notes suggest I had an ND filter on for these pictures. That possibly didn't help much either.</p>

<p>No early adventures for us today but we didn't have to leave the house to see a range of weather, including a gorgeous sunrise and snow from the lounge window. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/R0000500.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/R0000500.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Sunrise</strong> Ricoh GRIII ISO 800 f/16 1/30s, pp in Capture One Pro 20</p>
<p>We packed and I loaded my last roll of film, a Kodak Portra 160. Replenishing the hire car's tank with about 20 litres of petrol cost about 200 Króna, the same as a single adult ticket to walk on the land nearby. We stopped at the huts in the place Kara had seen from that walk yesterday, and I ran off the final frames before packing the exposed rolls into a poly bag for easy security inspection at the airport.</p>
<p>Check in made us feel like children again as a nice lady talked us through getting a luggage tag printed at the self-service machines, and loading our bags onto the automatic conveyor. Duty-free was actually cheap and I couldn't resist buying a pack of <em>Kvikk Lunsj</em>. Interestingly, security did a visual check of the bag of film stock at my request (once the supervisor had OK'd it), so the only scan my rolls have had was at the grumpy airport at Edinburgh. I think I'm going to have to try to find out what the rules are on this - were the Faroese just being nice, reasonable people, or were the Scots just being bastards? I'd like to know but from a Kodak article I read yesterday the hand luggage scanners at airports are of too low a power to affect film stock significantly, even with multiple scans.</p>
<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-faroes-trip-later">Later</h3>
<p>At home, I packed the rolls off to AG Photo in Birmingham using their pre-paid mailer. Grand total of the processing costs from the trip is just under forty quid.</p>

<p>The second roll of Portra I used on the last day, as we cleared out of the house and hit the road for the airport. On the way there, we stopped at the roadside to capture the fishing huts.</p>

<p>There hasn't been, as far as I can tell. None of the film rolls were over ISO 400, and the airport scanners nowadays seem to be quite low energy, although there is some concern, especially with the increase in the use of CT scanners at airports, mainly in the US. See <a href="https://petapixel.com/2020/01/27/kodak-warns-users-new-ct-scanners-at-airports-will-ruin-your-film/">this post from Petapixel</a>, for example, which reports on advice from Kodak that there is evidence of significant damage to film every time it is scanned.

<strong>03 Julian Alps, one of the images in my LRPS Panel.</strong> Fuji X-T2 16mm ISO 200 f/11</p>
<p>The Royal Photographic Society has recommended a panel of my photographs for the distinction of Licentiate (LRPS). This, some 8 months after my wife and I first submitted, with one of us being awarded LRPS immediately. </p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-lrps-the-lrps-panel">The LRPS Panel</h2>
<p>I had to make changes to one of my images (09 Fenchurch Street) to remove distracting lines that were at first taken to be a printing error. </p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-lrps-panel-layout">Panel Layout</h2>
<p>Sometimes called the eleventh image, the layout of the panel of photographs is an important aspect for the assessors. There has to be a pleasing aesthetic to the arrangement and balance of the images when displayed as a complete body. I spent far too long worrying about details of aspect ratio and colour balance across the panel, I think. The advisory day was useful to get a sense of what the assessors like. These are things like the two faces looking inwards, similar colours at each end of a row, those kinds of spectrumy details that provide satisfaction for a critical viewer, and they are, critical.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-02-06-lrps-next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>I am pleased to have finally achieved this distinction which I take to be an acknowledgement that I am learning something about photography. I'd like to continue my artistic journey by developing my knowledge and skills of the photographic process. I have continued this through making the improvements required to the panel first submitted, and by exploring composition using medium format film, for example.</p>

<em>Rainbow over Earlsferry</em> iPhone</p>
<p>We love a road trip and had been promising ourselves a little get-away day for the past couple of weeks. Having worked together all morning to tidy the house, we finally sorted the camera gear and jumped in the car to head up the coast of Fife towards the East Neuk and the little town of Earlsferry.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-03-08-the-east-neuk-earlsferry">Earlsferry</h2>
<p>We went to the shore at the Western edge of the town to exercise ourselves and our gear. Kara was keen to get some long exposures and I went looking for contrast as I had both the Fuji GW and Nikon FM loaded with black and white film<sup id="fnref:exp"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-03-08-the-east-neuk-fn:exp">1</a></sup>. This is Bass Rock, taken with the Fuji:</p>

<em>Bass Rock through wall</em> Fuji GW690ii, Ilford Pan F Plus 50 f/22 at 1/15s</p>

<em>Bass Rock</em> Nikon FM AI-s 28mm f/2.8, Delta 400 f/22 at 1/125s. Yellow filter.</p>
<p>The difference between the above two images goes beyond what you see, which is as much down to what I did with the image after it was developed as it is the difference in the two cameras. The Fuji is a medium format camera and produces negatives which are 6cm by 9cm in size: six times larger than those produced in the 35mm Nikon FM. This only really makes a difference if you want to make very large prints from the negatives, when the limitations of the photographer are as significant as anything else. This, I think, will torment me for the next few years as I develop and learn. What this big Fuji isn't going to do, I am learning, is give me 350 mega-pixel images in super-sharp crispy detail, not at least until I learn how to manage and operate the equipment better.</p>
<p>The Nikon made some more good images of the wonderful coastline here. I was using a Tiffen yellow filter to give contrast and texture in the sky at the same time as sustaining details in the shadows.</p>

<p>St Monans is famous for its zig-zag breakwater but is also where Kara's family have deep fishing roots. We drove around the town and enjoyed a brilliant sky as the weather pushed and tugged at the air over the Forth Estuary, making rainshafts, cloud patterns, whooping, whacking waves on the rocks and double bows over the Eastern landscape. Food lust overcame us, so we headed for the world-famous Anstruther chippie and enjoyed proper fish and chips in the car as it got dark.</p>

We had our own challenge with the rapidly incoming tide.</p>

<em>Kinghorn, 2020</em> f/22 at 1/200s </p>
<p>In a <a href="#stories-2020-2020-03-14-kinghorn-beach">recent post</a>, I mentioned that I had bought a new-to-me Agfa Isolette I camera. In it, I discovered as I opened the back, was an old roll of Kodacolor II. I closed the back and rolled it on to the next frame. A couple of days later, when my wife and I went to the beach for some relief from the emerging COVID-19 situation, I took the camera along.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-03-21-1983-kodacolorii-exposure-heuristics">Exposure heuristics</h2>
<p>On the beach, having not really thought about it properly, I decided to finish the film off. The Isolette doesn't have a meter, and I'd forgotten my Gossen, so I figured I'd give the "Sunny 16" rule a try. This goes something like: "if it's sunny, and you're shooting at f/16, then the shutter speed is the inverse of the film speed." I later discovered that this fim had a speed rating of 100 ASA, but at the time I guessed that it might be a 400, so went for a shutter speed of 1/200th of a second at f/22. This blunder might have been mitigated against by the well-known heuristic or rule-of-thumb for expired films stock, which suggests that you should treat the film as being slower by 1 stop for every decade it is out of date. So, I should have rated the original 100 ASA film at 25. If all of those estimates and rules were correct, I was effectively underexposing on the beach by about 4 stops. They weren't.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-03-21-1983-kodacolorii-results">Results</h2>
<p>The film was turned round by the brilliant <a href="https://www.ag-photolab.co.uk/">AG Photolab</a> in double-quick time, and I got to the scanner to have a look at these images. I wasn't expecting stellar quality images and wasn't disappointed. I pulled the scans into Capture One to see if I could do anything but in the end, I just cropped and exported them. </p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-03-21-1983-kodacolorii-the-effect-of-age-on-film-emulsion">The effect of age on film emulsion</h2>
<p>The recent exposures at Kinghorn show quite a lot of fogging and what looks to me like a fungal film over the whole frame. There is evidence of light leaking into the frame at the top and bottom. I can't explain this because the back of the camera hinges open - the central frames I inadvertently exposed when I opened the camera when I first unpacked it are as you'd expect. The red fog at the edges appears across the whole film. This is one of the frames exposed last week:</p>

<p>The exposures from the beginning of the film were perhaps made when it was put into the back of the cupboard, or wherever, back in the 1980s when this little Isolette was last used before finding itself washed up on eBay. I have no idea where they were taken but the houses look familiar, as if in a garden city like Letchworth or Rosyth. The colours are endearing, unsurprisingly retro, perhaps.</p>

<p>This was fun. I think I'll try to clean up the camera a bit and try another roll.</p>

<em>Earlsferry, Fife.</em></p>
<p>Ilford Delta is a well-known black and white film from the famous UK manufacturer that has been around for almost 30 years. I put a roll of 400 through a Nikon FM. This post describes some of the images I made and what I did with them. The film was exposed over the first few weeks of 2020 and sent to AG Photographic in Birmingham for developing.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-03-22-delta-400-harlow-water">Harlow Water</h2>
<p>We had to take a trip to Essex in January and had time to take a walk along the River Stort that runs through a generic-looking town on the outskirts of London. The river seems clean enough to sustain life, as there were people fishing along the banks. The first image here is a crop: bottom right you can see fading from what looks like a light leak in the camera. I think it's something to do with the back plate. I bought this camera from eBay to replace my original 1970s Nikon FM that has a condemned shutter, and the back doesn't shut cleanly with the satisfying click of my original.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/20-3-22-Delta-400-18.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/20-3-22-Delta-400-18.jpg"/></a>
<em>Harlow Water</em></p>
<p>Not sure I'd be eating any of the fish they caught, as there were dog walkers kicking their poochy-poo directly from where it was dropped on the tow path into the river. I asked one of the fishermen if this is normal behaviour round here. He said everybody did it. I was disappointed with that level of cultural disrespect amongst the dog-walking people of this town towards their environment. Despite being in the middle of an industrial estate, this little stretch of river, with its abandoned house-boats, is pretty, and no doubt home to a lot of life. It's worth exploring - there's more information <a href="https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/places-to-visit/harlow">here</a>.</p>

<em>Harlow Water</em></p>
<p>The next image has been adjusted for tone in Capture One for a more vintage look. This might offend some "analogue" purists but I'm just playing here. There aren't any rules, and Capture One is a nice tool for messing about with images that might otherwise be considered uninteresting.</p>

<em>Harlow Mill</em></p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-03-22-delta-400-the-fife-coast">The Fife Coast</h2>
<p>When I next picked up the camera, we were up the <a href="#2020-03-08-the-east-neuk">East Neuk</a>. I continued the split toning exercise with the next two frames, toning the shadows blue and the highlights in the complementary yellow.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/20-3-22-Delta-400-22.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/20-3-22-Delta-400-22.jpg"/></a>
<em>Bass Rock</em></p>
<p>Here, the Forth River basks in sunrays from an approaching storm. The toning enhances, I think the menacing clouds and waters. For monochrome images, it might seem weird to re-introduce colour but I think as an artistic technique, it enhances these shore photos. It didn't work for me with the Harlow Water images.</p>

<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-03-22-delta-400-kinghorn-beach">Kinghorn Beach</h2>
<p>The last of these photographs was taken a few days later, down on the beach at Kinghorn. It is untoned but suffers with the same light leak problem I talked about above. This image was taken in portrait orientation and cropped slightly to make use of the false flare. I think it looks OK.</p>

<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-03-22-delta-400-summary-of-the-results">Summary of the results</h2>
<p>Reviews of this film suggest that it is very sharp, although I am sure that this is true only when in better hands. I am not convinced that I get the best results by sending it to AG Photographic, although I don't doubt they are the best of the labs out there. Perhaps this is just a manifestation of the Dunning-Kruger effect and I'll change my mind once I learn more about it. </p>
<p>When I took a roll of photographs back in the 1970's and 1980's, I would consider it a success if I got one or two good frames from a roll of 135. I think I have half a dozen here that I'm pleased with, despite the leaky light problem. A significant factor in this increased success rate must be the greater opportunity there is to work with the images post-processing. Even the scanning tool <sup id="fnref:SF8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-03-22-delta-400-fn:SF8">1</a></sup> allows me to straighten the horizon.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-03-22-delta-400-next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>I will try this film again and process it myself to see if I get better results, but also maybe I ought to stop buying old cameras online and expecting them to perform optimally without at least letting someone who knows what they are doing check them over for me.</p>

Frame 24 <em>Bass Rocks</em></p>
<p>This film was in my Nikon FM between 10th January and 14th March 2020. It was processed by AG Photolab. I switched lens part way through this film to a new 28mm f/2.8 Nikon which is very much better than the E series lens I had been using. At the same time, I added a Tiffen Yellow filter which made sky contrast much better too.</p>

Frame 8 <strong>Inside the Monk's cave</strong></p>
<p>This is the first roll of my own film I have put through this little Agfa Isolette (see what I did there?). My wife and I went out during the so-called lockdown for some messages and a little exercise, having heard on the news that it's OK to get in your car and take a short drive to somewhere local if it helps you remain socially distanced enough to fight the spread of COVID-19. We decided that a walk on a beach would be safer and more responsible than a walk in the local park.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-04-04-self-isoletting-with-kodak-t-max-400-stupid-is-as-stupid-does">Stupid is as stupid does</h2>
<p>I'm still not quite myself following a recent loss, but I make no excuses for myself: the first four exposures on this film in the camera were all carefully exposed without remembering to advance the film. I re-took the building (Charles Hill Battery) on frame 2 using the same settings.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/2020-04-17-Kodak-TMY-2.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/2020-04-17-Kodak-TMY-2.jpg"/></a>
Frame 2 <strong>Building</strong></p>
<p>I double-exposed again on frame 4, re-taking the shots in 5 and 6. Apparently, photography is good for mindfulness. One of the scans, of the Monk's Cave, where monks used to wait for the boat to take them to Inchcolm Island out in the Forth, I processed using the Nik Collection Silver Efex Pro 2 application to bring out the detail in the sky and foreground. I quite like it:</p>

<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-04-04-self-isoletting-with-kodak-t-max-400-processing">Processing</h2>
<p>I like this film, known as TMY, because it's reliably good and very tolerant of my handling. This roll I processed myself, using 50:1 Rodinal R09 for 18 minutes and Kodak Fixer/Hardener. I had the devil of a job getting the film on the Paterson Reel and got quite grumpy at myself. The development went OK once I'd sorted out my fingers and thumbs. I scanned a selection of the frames on my Epson using their dreadful Silverfast 8 software and noticed that pretty much every one had a band across the top, presumably from a light leak in the camera somewhere. You can see it in the building image above, and faintly in the tree image:</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/2020-04-17-Kodak-TMY-12.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/2020-04-17-Kodak-TMY-12.jpg"/></a>
Frame 12. <strong>Dead tree</strong></p>
<p>I really don't think I am going to worry about it - this camera cost me less than twenty quid including postage so a professional CLA<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-04-04-self-isoletting-with-kodak-t-max-400-fn:1">1</a></sup> is not economically viable. Quite probably the light seals along the bottom of the camera are just needing replaced, a job I might do in a future lock-down.</p>
<p>The scanned tiff files were converted in Capture One, with a bit of contrast adjustment and cropping in the header image.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-04-04-self-isoletting-with-kodak-t-max-400-summary-of-the-results">Summary of the results</h2>
<p>I notice that I didn't deviate from 1/200s shutter speed with this roll. It was quite bright and so perhaps 400 ISO wasn't right for the conditions, given that this camera's shutter doesn't go any faster than that. Even inside the Monk's cave (above), I was exposing for the surfaces lit directly from the outside.</p>

<p>All images on this page taken with an Agfa Isolette I fitted with the Agfa Agnar 1:4.5/85 lens. The film used was Kodak TMY, or T-Max 400 Black &amp; White film, rated at EI 400. Cost £6.40 per roll from Analog Wonderland. Exposed on 4th April 2020, processed at home in Rodinal R09 one shot, works out at something like 75p per shot.</p>

<em>Unknown family group</em></p>
<p>A few years ago, my wife was given a box of cameras and bits, including an old Coronet Consul box camera. Recently, we dug it out and I had a play around with it. It was absolutely goosed<sup id="fnref:fubar"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-04-11-lost-and-found-fn:fubar">1</a></sup>, but it did contain a roll of exposed film. Having recently started playing with home development, I binned the camera and processed the roll in Rodinal R09, just to see what we might find. </p>
<p>I thought we might find some pictures of my wife's family back in the day, but it seems the uncle who gifted the box had picked the camera up at a car boot sale. I scanned a couple of frames and put them into Capture One to tweak the exposure and try to recover as much as I could. The header on this page is an example, and I have no idea who these people are. It looks like a nice family enjoying a proper British 1960's holiday on the Costa Brava.</p>

<em>Pattiesmuir, Ricoh GRIII</em></p>
<p>We took a walk down at Pattiesmuir again, because we can and we need to. I took my Nikon FM loaded with Kodak Portra 800 this time, and my little Ricoh GR III in my pocket. This gave me a picture to share on Instagram (above) when we got home - with a fresh 36-exposure roll of Portra, which I got developed later<sup id="fnref:july"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-04-30-pattiesmuir-fn:july">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This little place is a secret haven for photographers, it's so photogenic and variable with the seasons. The bluebells are coming, after the last frosts have become ancient history. The wild garlic is flowering, too, and the whole place, with its gnarled stumps and undergrowth on the hill, is magical.</p>

<em>Still life</em> Portra 800, Nikon FM, AI-s 28mm f/2.8 </p>
<p>The film I started on this outing was pretty much wasted, as most of the shots had what I described as "flare". AG, the film processing business I use, were very helpful and suggested these were light leaks in the camera - I put the Nikon in for a proper clean, lube, adjust and had the light seals replaced. The Fuji GW690ii also, and my old Nikon FM body. </p>
<p>I think that when everything works (i.e. the camera, the operator), this film stock works really well, even if at the moment most of what I am taking is pretty dull stuff.</p>

Frame 28. <em>Young tree shoots</em></p>
<p>Kodak Professional Ektachrome E100 is a new, fine grained colour transparency film perfectly suited to bright spring sunshine and the countryside. In good light, I have always favoured Kodak transparency film for colour saturation, so this first time out for me with Kodak's new T-grain modern slide film was a good exercise.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-05-18-sunshine-walks-soaking-up-the-sunshine-at-pattiesmuir">Soaking up the sunshine at Pattiesmuir</h2>
<p>The April sun was splitting the sky, so we went out around Pattiesmuir, a local walking route which winds through rural pathways and copses, offering glimpses of the iconic Forth bridges and over rolling farmland.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/img20200518_17325634.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/img20200518_17325634.jpg"/></a>
Frame 3. <em>Pattiesmuir</em></p>
<p>My wife and I have been going out with cameras for a number of years, both of us using Fuji X-series digital cameras usually. Recently, though, I have left the digital behind, and carried only a film camera. The more careful selections I am making is, I think, good for my photography because it slows me down and makes me think more carefully about framing, intent and especially the light. As a result, I do not take as many frames as I would with a digital camera in my hands. I find it hard to finish a roll of 36 in one go, and today was no exception. </p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-05-18-sunshine-walks-norton-common">Norton Common</h2>
<p>I next picked up the camera when, on another sunny day, we took ourselves on a bitter-sweet reflective walk on Norton Common. Earlier that day, we had said goodbye to my beloved Mum and it felt right to take ourselves to this special place in my old hometown. We found deer, and squirrels, sunbeams and forget-me-nots there, all of which seemed to be speaking to us in some way that was comforting.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/img20200518_19103767.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/img20200518_19103767.jpg"/></a>
Frame 24. <em>Forget-me-nots</em></p>
<p>We had stayed in a little Air B&amp;B in the pretty village of Great Wymondley, the smaller of the two Wymondleys, not far from the A1. The country kitchen of the old stable block featured a table where we had sat in the sunrays and listened to the voices of the host's children playing at the big house. There were poppies.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/img20200518_19224915.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/img20200518_19224915.jpg"/></a>
Frame 30 <em>Poppies</em></p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-05-18-sunshine-walks-rosyth">Rosyth</h2>
<p>The remaining half dozen frames were made on short exercise trips out the back door and into the park during the continuing COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/img20200518_19410207.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/img20200518_19410207.jpg"/></a>
Frame 35 <em>Blossom</em></p>
<p>Blossom is so photogenic, and we are lucky to be living in a place where there is plenty to be found at this time of year.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-05-18-sunshine-walks-the-camera">The camera</h2>
<p>The camera I used for this roll was an eBay-sourced Nikon FM of similar vintage to my old FM, whose shutter was sadly condemned last year. It feels very similar but different, not least because the focusing screen is quite mucky, which reminds me every time I frame a shot that this is a substitute for my <em>real</em> Nikon FM. It's just not the same. I am loving the lens, however, which is the superb AI-s 28mm f/2.8 which gives excellent results across a range of apertures.</p>

<p>Holiday how the Scots do it</p>

<strong>Achmelvich beach</strong>, X-T2 XF35mm, ISO 1600 f/2 at 1/1000s</p>
<p>Emerging confidently from weeks of COVID-19 lockdown and the sting of a cancelled Hebridean trip at Easter, we consoled ourselves with a few days immersed in the beauty of the Sutherland Assynt.</p>
<p>I went armed with a full complement of cameras (five - count them. Who needs five cameras?), most of which I now fit into a new kitBrick which I picked up at Tiso in Perth on the way up. Finally, I have a camera kit bag solution that works for all the gear I carry on a trip like this.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-07-14-assynt-achmelvich">Achmelvich</h2>
<p>The drive was long but pleasant, in a new (to us) Mercedes GLA, which is much more suited to the kind of driving one does on a trip to the Northwest of Scotland than the saloon it replaced. We took a look at Achmelvich beach after settling in to the apartment we had AirBnB'd for a few nights. Everything seems booked up, which seems weird, given that there are almost no overseas visitors to these shores at present and the roads are almost utterly empty.</p>

<p>We returned to Achmelvich a couple of times, well, because we love it, even if the weather doesn't always love us. The machair is in full bloom at the moment. The local people care for it by mowing swards through the meadow-like grass to encourage visitors not to trample randomly over the new growth. There are visitors here apart from ourselves: I edited out the tent on the beach in the next photo, because camping isn't allowed on the beach at Achmelvich.</p>

<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-07-14-assynt-stac-pollaidh">Stac Pollaidh</h2>
<p>We took the walking route around Stac Pollaidh. There's a new, lottery-funded, improved path here to protect the slopes and give the old well-trodden path a chance to recover. </p>

<p>Although we hadn't really intended to, we took the higher path, and reached the ridge near the top, which in retrospect, is something we feel good about. Going the last few metres higher required better climbing experience, gear, or stupidity. Fortunately, we had left ours at the fork in the lower path.</p>

<p>On a long meandering drive around the Coigach peninsula, the light changed constantly. Waze told us we were 2 hours from our apartment as we turned for home, yet only 37 km distant. This is because, perhaps, the twisty single-track roads ought to be driven only at 20 kph. The streams and foliage, deer and passing places pass by the window even at that speed, every now and then opening up wide open skies, the cotton grass stretching to the distant hills.</p>

<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-07-14-assynt-stoer-and-clachtoll">Stoer and Clachtoll</h2>
<p>This holiday was a good way to get familiar with a new car and I felt comfortable enough after a day or so to take it off-road down to a fisheries bothy at Stoer. We got chatting to a ranger when were here last October about whales and dolphins. We had promised to send the Mercedes dealer a picture of the car from our trip.</p>

<p>One of our favourite places (of all the favourite places we have around this part of Scotland) is Clachtoll beach, which at the time we visited, was at high tide. </p>

<p>The final day of our holiday was spent much further South, in Glencoe, stopping on the way down to make a brew and eat BLT sandwiches and cheese<sup id="fnref:cheese"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-07-14-assynt-fn:cheese">1</a></sup> on the gravelly beach at Loch Lochy. Even with a wind, that was paradise.</p>

<p>We checked in to The Corran by the ferry terminal and headed straight out for a walk along the Coupall to catch some time with Buachaille Etive Mòr.</p>

<p>This is a magical place, even in the rain. Actually, probably <em>especially</em> in the rain. The heather and harebells, dancing in the wind to the syncopation of the river rushing over the rocks, flail and flutter, the great herdsman above, indifferent to their earnest performance.</p>

<p>The day's adventure concluded with a flaccid fish supper from the Quarrier's Kitchen in Ballachulish, before heading back to Corran to journal the day. </p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-07-14-assynt-home">Home</h2>
<p>The drive home was wet but not without adventure as we stopped at Tindrum, more to support the business than to buy stuff we actually needed. We marvelled at how busy it was, and how heavy the Northbound traffic was, caravans and campers heading in droves for the NC500 and the midges.</p>
<p>We stopped briefly at Achnambeithatch, the little white cottage below Bidean nam Bian on the A82, to watch the weather for a while. </p>

<p>We decided that the rain was in for the day, so headed South, and lunched at the King's House, as much to their delight as ours, emerging as they were for the first day back in business after months of COVID-19 closure. </p>

<p>There are more images associated with this post, taken with the Nikon FM using <a href="#exposures-2020-2020-11-07-ilford-orthochrome-80">Ilford Orthochromatic film</a>. I am a bit disappointed with the film photos on this trip. I hoped for better, sharper, images but am just not getting that with the big Fuji GW690ii at the moment. I am making errors, <a href="#exposures-2020-2020-06-07-lomography-potsdam-100">losing an entire roll</a> from an earlier trip by using stop bath instead of developer, and the <a href="#exposures-2020-2020-07-13-lomography-berlin-400">Lomo Berlin</a> film I had in the GW690iii on this trip, which I ruined by using the wrong developer.

<p>There's nothing like a walk on a beach, especially when it's one of the long, windy, sea-birdy beaches like you find along the coast near Dunbar. We took ourselves off to Belhaven beach for such a walk, to clear the head, and to reset our fish supper metrics after a bad experience at Ballachulish.</p>
<p>I'm finding myself using a mix of digital and film cameras when I'm out. When I need to shoot quickly, it's more likely that I'll grab the Ricoh in my pocket, like when I noticed a figure walking across the scene before us:</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/R0000655.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/R0000655.jpg" title="Lone figure walking"/></a>
<strong>Socially distant</strong> Ricoh GRIII, cropped and desaturated</p>
<p>I keep the Ricoh in aperture-priority mode at f/16 when shooting landscape, if the light is OK. It really is a fabulous camera, and more than once I've thought that if I could only have one camera, it would be this one. If I could only have no cameras, I'd still have my phone, which is a pretty amazing piece of kit.</p>

<strong>Dirty little sisters</strong></p>
<p>It's been a few months now, since I started shooting film again. Needless to say, I've had some results I am very pleased with, and a whole series of disappointments and frustrations with myself on the way.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-07-30-film-cameras-focusing-the-fuji">Focusing the Fuji</h2>
<p>My monster medium-format Fuji GW690ii (above, centre) is a rangefinder on steroids, one of a series of cameras known as the "Texas Leicas" on account of their size. They were made for Japanese bus tour customers, who got a souvenir snap of the group as they visited Mt. Fuji, or Kyoto, which was developed and printed in time for the end of the trip. The huge 6cm x 9cm negatives it produces are large enough to render detail from the fixed 90mm lens even when enlarged and printed for the office wall. I bought a "near mint" one from <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/odacamerajapan">ODA-Japan</a> at the end of 2019 for over £500 including taxes and fees. From the listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grade: Near Mint - Pre-owned, minimal signs of use. Appearance is very beautiful, tiny scuffs from normal use. It shows signs of use. *Please check photos. New Light Seals!! Optics:<finder> Beautiful condition.</finder></p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of those words, I have learned, describe the camera. I had been disappointed with some of the photos taken with it. This, for example, taken on Kinghorn Beach, I hoped would be much clearer:</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/20-3-20-Pro50-8.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/20-3-20-Pro50-8.jpg"/></a>

<p>Sometimes sharpness doesn't matter too much. This image, taken on a trip to the Faroes before the COVID lockdown, still looks pretty nice to me, not least because the Portra film I was using is just wonderful if you catch the light right:</p>

<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-07-30-film-cameras-two-nikon-fms">Two Nikon FMs</h2>
<p>My old Nikon FM, which went everywhere I did as I travelled with the military and then work from 1977 to the turn of the century, had been condemned by <a href="https://www.hlehmann.co.uk/">Lehmans</a> as being beyond repair, specifically, the shutter mechanism, for which no spares are available. Its "FULLY TESTED <em>EXCELLENT</em>" replacement I had bought from <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/secameras">SE Cameras</a> (eBay) has never been right, showing light leaks and odd exposure variations. Here's an example:</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/20-3-22-Delta-400-34.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/20-3-22-Delta-400-34.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Parasurfers at Kinghorn, Nikon FM</strong>, Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8, Ilford Delta 400, f/16 at 1/125s. Yellow filter.</p>
<p>The light leaks were particularly bad in a recent film - 20 of the 36 exposures were spoiled - and this is what triggered me to finally take action and get professional help.</p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-07-30-film-cameras-the-cla">The CLA</h2>
<p>Practice makes perfect, they say, and they also say that a bad workman blames his tools. That said, I bet even Chippendale launched more than one of his chisels across the workshop on his learning journey. Ergo, I decided recently to get these cameras "CLA"-ed, or <em>clean, lubricate, and adjust</em>-ed. </p>
<p>I took the two Nikons and the Fuji to a little repair shop in Morningside, Edinburgh and asked, if possible, for them to make one good camera out of the two Nikons, and fix any focusing problems there might be in the Fuji. All I really wanted to know is whether the criticism I have had of recent photographs is all down to poor technique, or whether it might - just might - be something to do with the camera.</p>
<p>I picked up the three cameras today, all in excellent working order, with a clear list of things that had been done to them and an assurance (and a reasonable limited warranty) that they are "to specification". Can't wait to get out with some film in them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't buy from eBay and expect things to be as described</li>

<p>I buy (too much) film from <a href="https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/">Analogue Wonderland</a>, and get it developed at <a href="https://www.ag-photolab.co.uk/">AG Photolab</a>, who have been brilliant in helping me make sense of some of the recent exposure problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cameratiks.co.uk/">Cameratiks</a> in Edinburgh is staffed by calm, competent and polite people who know what they are doing. They are not cheap, nor are they expensive: you can buy quality digital and film gear there, and have them offer decent advice on the basis that you will go back there next time you need anything.

<p>A recent run up to Crail on a sunny weekend was all the excuse I needed to drop a roll of Kodak Ektachrome into my recently CLA-d Fuji GW690ii. We played with the waves crashing on the rocks for a while, and let the coastal breeze blow away the COVID cobwebs. I finished the film off on a run to Dunkeld. A week later, development is done and the transparencies returned from the excellent AG Photo Lab.</p>

<strong>Crail beach.</strong> Some adjustment in Capture One (horizon).</p>
<p>At 320 dpi, these transparencies, scanned in an Epson V600 yield an image around 90 Megapixels in a file something over 250MB in size. The scanner can do more, but there's no advantage for most of my images at the moment. I notice that letting the scanner do dust removal or sharpening introduces digital artefacts. I know it's clever and all, but I hate it when machines do the thinking for you, without asking permission first. I guess the next step might be a move to direct printing, and to skip the digital completely. How will I share that with you? Maybe post a photograph.</p>

<p>I took my little Agfa Isolette, loaded with Kodak Ektachrome E100 to nearby Kinghorn beach, a place my wife and I often go to for a bit of headspace and diversion from the rest of the world. </p>
<h2 id="stories-2020-2020-10-04-e100-isolette-sunny-16-will-do">Sunny 16 will do</h2>
<p>Despite the habits of the digital age, for this roll, I didn't record all the exposure details, going broadly with "sunny 16", occasionally referring to an app on my iPhone for aperture and shutter speed combinations that might be reasonable. It was a bright, partly sunny day, and I took some of the shots at 1/50 s hand-held, although some were at 1/200 s or between these two. Apertures were between f/8 and f/16, mostly. I finished the film and sent it to AG for developing with another E100 I had recently finished in my <a href="#stories-2020-2020-10-04-e100-gw690">Fuji GW690ii</a>.</p>

<p>The transparencies were scanned in an Epson V600. At 6400 dpi, this yields a file around 750 MB in size, and an image approaching 250 megapixels, but this is not anything like equivalent to "better than a Fuji GFX" unless the camera and photographer have combined to capture the absolute highest quality image possible. I certainly am not consistently getting that kind of precision, even if the camera can, but it won't stop me trying. I scanned these at 3200 dpi for an image nearer 50 Megapixels in a file under 200MB after cropping.</p>

<p>It's not lost on me that a roll of this film, with processing, costs more than the camera did. I'm sure that's not a unique situation but given that the Agfa Isolette is a medium format camera, and the quality of the capture and rendering are, in my view, pretty good, then I am left wondering why I am also happy, from time to time, to launch a grand or more on a digital camera. Maybe those days are over.</p>
<p>The variation in exposures in this roll are certainly operator error. I do a lot of calculating while I shoot, having never developed any real "intuitive feel" for exposure over the years. There's time yet -- as Henri Cartier-Bresson says, "your first 10,000 photographs are your worst".</p>

<p>I didn't record the rest of the exposure details, but went broadly with "sunny 16", occasionally referring to an app on my iPhone. It was a bright, partly sunny day, and I took some of the shots at 1/50 s hand-held, although some were at 1/200 s or between these two. Apertures were between f/8 and f/16, mostly. I finished the film and sent it to AG for developing with another E100 I had finished in the Fuji GW690ii.</p></section><section class="print-page" id="stories-2020-2020-10-30-berlin-400-isolette"><h1 id="stories-2020-2020-10-30-berlin-400-isolette-berlin-at-dunkeld-in-october">Berlin at Dunkeld in October</h1>

<strong>The Hermitage</strong></p>
<p>My wife and I celebrated our first anniversary by returning to Dunkeld, where we were married. We had time, this time, to walk more slowly, considering only ourselves, and to enjoy the nature of the place. We both took cameras and enjoyed playing in the outdoors, visiting favourite places and just breathing the air.</p>

<strong>A Tayside walk by Dunkeld House Hotel</strong></p>
<p>I took my little old Afga Isolette, a ridiculously cheap camera (some of the film I put through it costs more than the camera did) that has no meter or gadgets to tell you where to set the dials. You have no choice but to figure it out according to the light and the film parameters, and what you're trying to achieve. </p>

<p>I have ditched the neurotic habit of writing down every exposure setting of every frame. Consequently, I've enjoyed my photography more, although I am less certain of good results. One benefit of living in the modern age is that we have tools to make adjustments after scanning to yield something not unpleasing. These were tweaked a little in Capture One to try and retain the character of the film, as well as trying to achieve a reasonable photograph. This example features a little colour toning in the highlights and shadows:</p>

<p>The first time I tried this film, I wrecked it with a stupid mistake in developing. This time, I sent it to AG photo for processing, not so much because I was afraid to develop it myself, but more because I have been too busy to do my own processing. </p>
<p>This roll I put through my little old Afga Isolette. Not much detail in the exposure list below because I have ditched the neurotic habit of writing down every exposure setting of every frame. I've enjoyed my photography more, although I am less certain of good results. Hopefully my success rate will improve with practice, if I learn anything as I go.</p>

<p>On a weekend break in Perthshire, I tried my hand at infra-red by dropping a roll of Ilford SFX 200 film in my Fuji GW690ii "Texas Leica" rangefinder camera. My wife and I were in Dunkeld celebrating our first anniversary, returning to where we were married. This year, autumn was on time and the Hermitage forest was just magnificent and we had time to enjoy it properly.</p>
<p>I've never used infra-red sensitive film before so I did a bit of reading about it before the trip: on the day, I put a Neewer IR720 filter on and took about 6 stops off the exposure estimates. I metered at ISO 200, which is the box speed for this film in visible light. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Ilford-SFX-200-20201106_18411489.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Ilford-SFX-200-20201106_18411489.jpg"/></a>
<strong>The Hermitage forest</strong></p>
<p>The exposures looked a couple of stops under when I got the film back from AG Labs, but there was plenty of detail available in the negatives to lift out. I had intended to develop the film at home but life's a bit busy at the moment for such pleasures. I scanned the film on an Epson V600 and made adjustments in Capture One Pro.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Ilford-SFX-200-20201106_18432539.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Ilford-SFX-200-20201106_18432539.jpg"/></a>
<strong>The river Braan above the Tay</strong></p>
<p>I have ditched my neurotic habit of writing down every exposure setting for every frame. Consequently, I've enjoyed my photography more, although I am less certain of good results. One benefit of living in the modern age is that we have tools to make adjustments after scanning to yield something not unpleasing. </p>

<strong>At the Hermitage, looking towards the bridge.</strong></p>
<p>The image at the top of the page is of the waterfall by Ossian’s Hall, which can just bee seen at the right of the frame. I cropped this down but kept the others on this page at the full size.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Ilford-SFX-200-20201106_18374061.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Ilford-SFX-200-20201106_18374061.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Hermitage forest trails. Long exposures revealed in the movement.</strong></p>
<p>I'm quite pleased with the results from my first time out with near-infra-red film. There's a slightly timeless look to the pictures caused by the rendering of foliage in infra-red wavelengths. Next time, maybe I'll seek brighter light and try longer exposures using the 850nm or 950nm filter.</p>

<p>I lost my mum in March this year, just as COVID was descending on the world. As long as I remember, she had always been keen, sometimes too keen, to capture a moment in a photograph. I inherited a rich and wonderful collection of albums and shoe-boxes full of family memories, and of quite a lot of people I don't recognise.</p>
<p>Amongst her possessions was a little point-and-shoot automatic 35mm camera, a Premier PC-645D. It still had a film in it. I took the camera with me on a couple of trips, including our anniversary weekend to Dunkeld, where we had been married the year before. In some sense, it was a way of making up for her not being able to travel up to Scotland for our wedding: we had taken her the albums of the wedding to see before she was admitted to hospital on Christmas Eve 2019. For a short while this year, it was as if she was with us.</p>
<p>Her final pictures were typical. This one, evidence of a mystery. A bungee strap had suddenly appeared with a clatter on the roof of her cottage one day, on the day a stowaway's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-48830212">body was found</a> in a Clapham garden. Mum was convinced that this strap had something to do with it and alerted the authorities, who took no interest. I told her that I thought it entirely feasible that the strap might be connected to the tragedy somehow.</p>

<strong>Bungee from the sky</strong></p>
<p>The second is of three visitors to her little house in Letchworth, Michelle, Marilyn and Tracey, cousins on the Brennan side (my grandmother's). Mum often had visitors; Michelle wrote of this visit:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title"> </p>
<p>I lost her phone number and we just went unannounced, but she still made us welcome. I'm so grateful we decided to go anyway as this was to be the last time we saw her. Letchworth captured my heart, and from the first time I went with my mum to re-unite with the cousins Audreys, I absolutely adored your mum, such a beautiful and fascinating lady. I will never forget all her advice, she taught me so much that I didn't know about our family on the Brennan side, especially the ones that emigrated to Canada.</p>

<strong>Three visitors</strong></p>
<p>We took a trip along the coast near us, to Crail. Here's my wife at work, and the kind of place mum would have enjoyed being if she were able to travel. Her health wasn't the best, it never had been, but she never offered it as an excuse or let it prevent her from living the most fruitful and interesting life. The crashing waves on this rocky coast would have been right up her street.</p>

<strong>Crail</strong></p>
<p>Finally, on the weekend to Dunkeld, I took a selfie for mum of my wife and I in the mirror in our suite, not taking into account the flash on this little point-and-shoot, "focus free" camera. I can't help thinking that the flare somehow indicates her presence with us on that day as we celebrated our anniversary, and remembered a remarkable woman.</p>

<strong>The castle wall</strong>, <em>Ilford Delta 3200</em></p>
<p>We went down to Gifford, in East Lothian, to find that the new owners of the farm have made walkers on the land very unwelcome. I wasn't in the mood for a fight, so we took a drive down to the golf club, where we were welcome to park, provided that we let them know in the clubhouse. It's nice to know there are still public-spirited folk out there.</p>
<p>I decided not to be burdened with camera gear, so just took my little Afga Isolette, which had a few frames left in it of a roll of Fuji Pro400H, and a roll of Ilford Delta 3200 in my pocket.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20201127_20085880.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20201127_20085880.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Part of the keep remains</strong>, <em>Ilford Delta 3200</em></p>
<p>A walk alongside the bunkers and greensward took us to one of our favourite haunts, Goblin Ha'. This magical place has been here for almost a thousand years and is full of stories and little hidey-places. The remains of the castle and keep are here, along with a subterranean crypt that can be accessed with care: the path is slippery and dangerous at the best of times, let alone in the wet seasons.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20201127_20114793.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Ilford-Delta-3200-20201127_20114793.jpg"/></a>
<strong>The underground crypt from outside</strong>, <em>Ilford Delta 3200</em></p>
<p>The Fuji 400H came back from <a href="https://www.ag-photolab.co.uk/">AG Labs</a> absolutely flat, which makes it easier to scan. I'd struggled recently with film stock curling in the scanner, spoiling my efforts to make nice, in-focus images. The images themselves were more contrasty and emotive in the Ilford photographs, in my view. Compare the above image with this one:</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Fujifilm-Pro400H-20201207_18485469.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Fujifilm-Pro400H-20201207_18485469.jpg"/></a>
<strong>The crypt from outside</strong>, <em>Fujifilm Pro 400H</em></p>
<p>This was a family outing: a chance for some of us to spend quality time together in this natural and mystical place, right for reflection. The setting was good for clearing heads and strengthening bonds. Little discoveries and the distraction of mindful photography made for a perfect autumnal break from the madness. </p>

<strong>A portal in the old castle wall</strong>, <em>Ilford Delta 3200</em></p>
<p>I developed the Delta 3200 film in 1:150 Rodinal R09 for an hour and scanned both on my Epson V600 at 4800 dpi. Most of the images are about 100 Mega pixels at that resolution and the negatives are nice and sharp. Not bad for a fifty-year old folder that cost me about the same as each roll of film did.</p>

<p>We took a weekend run up the coast to Crail and the Kilminning nature reserve, and we played on the beach at Lower Largo. I used up my last roll of Acros in my GW690ii rangefinder -- I thought it was polite to put Fuji in Fuji.</p>

<strong>The Forth Estuary</strong> Acros II</p>
<p>The estuary is wide at this point, and the North Sea lies beyond to the East. Oil rigs work the natural resources. Shipping passes and wildlife abounds as the waves are expressive and sincere in their tidal cadence. The people love the beaches, where cares are blown away and life slows to reveal its meaning.</p>

<p>I developed the Acros film at home in Rodinal R09 for an hour, turning once half-way, which I regret. The highlights might have been less bright if I hadn't, and retained more detail.</p>

<p>December, 2020. After Christmas. Some thoughts at the end of an interesting year.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF7687.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF7687.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Glenquey reservoir</strong></p>
<p>Like many people, I don't see the point of making resolutions at the end of the year, only to break them within a few days of returning to normal life, its pressures and temptations. This year, the (first?) year of pandemic restrictions, has given us all opportunities to reflect a little: the reflection necessarily includes looking at oneself. Here is where we see ourselves more objectively -- in the moments of noticing just how we change as we get older. Perhaps also, we observe how we have <em>not changed</em> when we ought to have.</p>
<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-12-28-resolutions-the-old-year">The old year</h3>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF7648.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF7648.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Glendevon</strong></p>
<p>Well, there's been COVID, of course, but there have been other things going on. We lost my Mum in March, after a 3-month circus tour of various hospitals and the lottery of the NHS that began on Christmas Eve 2019. Others left us too, and there is sadness more than usual this Christmas as we remember them. Without diminishing our losses, there has also been much joy: weddings, our own first anniversary which was spent in favourite places around Dunkeld; and the last instalments of our honeymoon with friends in the North, and then even further North in the Faroes.</p>
<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-12-28-resolutions-the-new-year">The new year</h3>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/DSF7674.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/DSF7674.jpg"/></a>
This image of a bridge at Glendevon<sup id="stories-2020-2020-12-28-resolutions-fnref:covid-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-12-28-resolutions-fn:covid-1">1</a></sup> suggests that as we cross into the New Year, the road may be slippery at times. We probably need to lose a bit of weight (I feel like I am 7ft 6in wide in places), and we certainly ought to slow down a bit. Working life, not to be ungrateful for my exciting and challenging job<sup id="fnref:rgu-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-12-28-resolutions-fn:rgu-1">2</a></sup>, has been more challenge than excitement in 2020. I have <em>COVID back</em> from <em>Zooming</em> too much from the couch, suffered nightmares from stress anxiety and have more than once drafted a desperate resignation letter. The Christmas break has reminded me of the blessings proper sleep brings. I resolve to sleep better. </p>
<p>Beyond the bridge, we are advised that we must not park in passing places, so as to not be a nuisance to others and obstruct their passage. This year, I have noticed even more that I have not been quite who I was before becoming an educator: ever since that career move in 2003, I have had an insidious, creeping feeling that I don't belong, that I am somehow in the way. I resolve to assert with confidence and authority, as I spent so long learning, my confidence and authority. May I not overdo that resolution. Or, may I do it so well I have to return to a more lucrative profession.</p>
<p>Or, maybe something else entirely. Not photography, perhaps, there's no money in that<sup id="fnref:nwmt"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-12-28-resolutions-fn:nwmt">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="stories-2020-2020-12-28-resolutions-photography">Photography</h3>
<p>The last sign to heed in our bridge image is <strong>"Danger of death"</strong>. Susan Sontag said, <em>"All photographs are memento mori"</em> and she is right, even outwith the context she said that in. Photography reminds us that time passes and we all tread steadfastly towards our own demise with each snap of the shutter. This is reason to be cheerful, isn't it? Death is inevitable, so there's no point in being sad about it. I am expecting something to fall off a shelf as I type that<sup id="fnref:audrey-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#stories-2020-2020-12-28-resolutions-fn:audrey-1">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I've been (re-)learning how to take photographs on film, and now feel confident enough to invest in my first Hasselblad, which will be here in a week or so. Clearly, I resolve to take many images with that, and to not neglect the other cameras I am privileged enough to own. Film photography, it is often said, requires a slower, more thoughtful approach than the spray-and-pray approach of digital. I can't disagree, and I have loved the more considered captures I have taken on 35mm and medium format film this year. My best images are often digital, though, so I am not going to <em>try not to</em> favour one format over the other.</p>

<p>Do your worst. No, wait. Don't do that. Do what you have to, to enjoy each day as if it's your last. To fill it with <em>joie-de-vivre</em>. To make music. To create. To love, and if possible, to be loved. Everything else is irrelevant.</p>

<strong>Sisters</strong> These were the film cameras I was using at the start of 2020.</p>
<p>I've returned to making film photographs after a long break, and a few years shooting digital.  There are pages in this secton on digital cameras also.</p>
<h2 id="cameras-35mm-format">35mm format</h2>
<p>My first "proper" camera was a Nikon FM SLR, which I bought second hand around 1977 in Hitchin with a 50mm lens. I soon after bought a Tamron 80-210mm zoom lens that I used from the 1980s until around 2002 when I boxed it all up and hid it for a few years. I have no idea what happened to the 50mm lens but the body was checked out by <a href="https://www.hlehmann.co.uk/">Lehmanns</a> in 2019 who condemned the shutter mechanism as BER<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cameras-fn:1">1</a></sup>. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/IMG_8568-FM.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/IMG_8568-FM.jpg"/></a>
<strong>The second FM</strong></p>
<p>I then bought another Nikon FM from <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/secameras">SE Cameras</a> in April 2019 for £90, along with a Nikon AI-s 50mm f/1.8 lens from the same seller for £80. That lens is one of the cheaper E series lenses and I’m not totally happy with the quality of it, so I have bought a Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8 lens on <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/photosound09">eBay</a> for £169. I’m also tempted by the 85mm f/1.4 but these are considerably pricier on eBay at the moment. Both lenses have a standard 52 mm filter ring.</p>
<h2 id="cameras-medium-format">Medium format</h2>
<p>My wife and I were out taking photos on a frosty morning at the end of 2019 when we met a chap in the woods with a boxy-looking camera with a waist level viewfinder. This turned out to be a Hasselblad 500 of some kind and I asked him quite a lot of questions about medium format film photography. He had bought his camera at <a href="https://www.ffordes.com/">Ffordes</a> in Inverness and I bought a dose of GAS<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cameras-fn:3">3</a></sup> from him. After a fair bit of reading and research, I decided I wanted to give medium format a try.  I bought a Fuji GW690ii<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cameras-fn:2">2</a></sup> from <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/odacamerajapan">ODA-Japan</a> at the end of 2019 for under $500 US, not including P&amp;P, the Amex foreign currency fees, VAT, import duty and local PO handling fees, which brought the actual cost to over £500 Sterling. The camera has a fixed 90mm lens with a 67 mm filter thread. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/IMG_8582.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/IMG_8582.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Because the Fuji doesn’t have a meter, I bought a Gossen Sixtino meter on eBay for £20. There’s also an app for my iPhone that’s very nice but it makes me feel dirty when I use it.</p>

<p>6th March 2020 I bought, on a whim, a cheap Vintage Agfa Isolette I medium format camera from <a href="https://www.ebay.com/usr/gotanyose">gotanyose</a> on eBay, for £18 including £4.50 p&amp;p.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Agfa Isolette Camera in Superb Condition. Agfa Agnar 1:4.5/85 Lens. Comes with original Flash.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found, on opening the back, that it still had a roll of Kodacolor II in it from when it was last used. On having the film developed<sup id="fnref:ag"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cameras-afga-isolette-fn:ag">1</a></sup>, I estimate this to have been from around 1980. Here is one of the original images from that roll:</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/20-3-20-KodacolorII-1.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/20-3-20-KodacolorII-1.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Roses, 1980s?</strong></p>
<p>I finished the roll but clearly the film had suffered over time.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/20-3-20-KodacolorII-10.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/20-3-20-KodacolorII-10.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Kinghorn, Fife, 2020</strong></p>
<p>The camera itself is a second version Isolette I, produced between 1955 and 1958, according to <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Isolette#Isolette_I">camera-wiki</a>.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/Isolette.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/Isolette.jpg"/></a>
<strong>Isolette</strong></p>
<p>The Isolette is a simple device: there is nothing electronic here, just a folding box with an f/4.5 Agnar 85mm fixed lens and Vario shutter. The film is advanced (if you remember<sup id="fnref:arse1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cameras-afga-isolette-fn:arse1">2</a></sup>) by winding a knob on the top of the camera body, and the lens shutter is cocked separately (if you remember<sup id="fnref:arse2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cameras-afga-isolette-fn:arse2">3</a></sup>). It does take a while to get used to, but the results are worth it -- big, 6cm x 6cm frames that at a 4800 dpi scan will yield beautiful 100 mega pixel digital images that have all the character of the film stock.</p>

<p>The shutter has three speeds: 1/25s, 1/50s and 1/200s, in addition to a bulb or B setting. The aperture runs from f/4.5 to f/32. Focusing distance is indicated in feet, with a separate ring indicating depth of field ranges for the selected aperture.</p>

<strong>The GW690ii in action</strong> in February 2020 during a trip to the Faroes.</p>
<p>My wife and I were out taking photos on a frosty morning at the end of 2019 when we met a chap in the woods with a boxy-looking camera with a waist level viewfinder. This turned out to be a Hasselblad 500 of some kind and I asked him quite a lot of questions about medium format film photography. He had bought his camera at <a href="https://www.ffordes.com/">Ffordes</a> in Inverness and I bought a dose of GAS<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cameras-fuji-gw690ii-fn:3">2</a></sup> from him. After a fair bit of reading and research, I decided I wanted to give medium format a try.  I bought a Fuji GW690ii<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cameras-fuji-gw690ii-fn:2">1</a></sup> from <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/odacamerajapan">ODA-Japan</a> at the end of 2019 for under $500 US, not including P&amp;P, the Amex foreign currency fees, VAT, import duty and local PO handling fees, which brought the actual cost to over £500 Sterling. The camera has a fixed 90mm lens with a 67 mm filter thread. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="/img/IMG_8582.jpg"><img alt="" src="/img/IMG_8582.jpg"/></a>
<strong>The Fuji is on the left</strong></p>
<p>Because the Fuji doesn’t have a meter, I bought a Gossen Sixtino meter on eBay for £20. There’s also an app for my iPhone that is very convenient.</p>
<p>I had light leaks with this camera from the outset, which was disappointing. I took it to <a href="https://www.cameratiks.co.uk/">Cameratiks</a> in Morningside for a CLA, along with two Nikon FM SLRs, who sorted it out for me.</p>
<p>I took the camera for a proper outing before the CLA, on a trip to the Faroes, which was part of our honeymoon in instalments. It was pretty nice:</p>

<strong>Huts near Vágar Airport</strong>, <em>f/11 1/60s, hand held. Kodak Portra 160.</em></p>
<p>The camera is completely mechanical and therefore fully manual. A fixed lens, and nothing to change except the aperture and shutter: both are adjusted by adjacent rings on the front of the lens. This is neat, because once you've got your EI worked out and set a shutter for a given aperture, you can turn both rings together, keeping the exposure but adjusting for (say) depth of field.</p>

<p>The Fuji X-T2 is a superbly designed and made digital camera. It has a substantial feel to it and everything works. The quality of the Fuji prime lenses is superb and when used on this camera, produces some stunning images. My first Fuji was an X-E2 rangefinder and I do love a rangefinder: the experience with this camera led me to buy a <a href="#cameras-fuji-x-t2-fuji-gw690ii">Fuji GW690</a> but I missed using the SLR form camera that I had learned on (a <a href="#cameras-fuji-x-t2-nikon-fm">Nikon FM</a>) and so I bought the X-T2.</p>

<p>I bit the bullet on my first Hasselblad on Boxing Day 2020. Experts will immediately notice that it's a bit of a <em>Frankenblad</em>, with an incongruous silver 1960's lens on a millennial 503CW body and magazine. There are fans of the older silver lenses, so perhaps it's not so monstrous a combination. Optically, the older lenses <a href="https://kenrockwell.com/hasselblad/80mm-f28-c.htm">aren't any different</a> to the newer ones, and the multi-coating of the <strong>T*</strong> lenses was more about marketing than optical performance, according to <a href="https://kenrockwell.com/hasselblad/80mm-f28-c.htm">Ken Rockwell</a>. What I have discovered is that the previous owner knew his Hasselblads and that this is a very good combination indeed.</p>
<h2 id="cameras-hasselblad-v-introduction-and-the-cost-of-hasselblads">Introduction and the cost of Hasselblads</h2>
<p>My wife and I <a href="#cameras-hasselblad-v-fuji-gw690ii">met a guy</a> one frosty morning, out in the countryside with a Hasselblad while his other half was at a car boot sale. He had bought the camera but was unable to tell his wife. I am more fortunate, and my wife is not averse to me owning a Hasselblad but we are  both educators and not that flush, so a little humility and frugality is in order. She has helped me be smart and not so impulsive, and had me talk her through the due diligence and research I have done since that first GAS<sup id="fnref:gasv"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cameras-hasselblad-v-fn:gasv">1</a></sup> attack a year ago. That said, I have had encouragement in my desire to own a Hasselblad camera system:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">do it ; - )</p>— Dr David Mitchell (@DSM888) <a href="https://twitter.com/DSM888/status/1334098543984906247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>The piece I refer to in that Tweet is David's <a href="https://www.japancamerahunter.com/2020/11/hasselblad-a-personal-reflection/">personal reflection</a> on the <a href="https://www.japancamerahunter.com">Japan Camera Hunter</a> blog, in which he sketches the history of Hasselblad and his own passion for the brand. In that  post, David describes the development of the cameras from the early models with focal plane shutters and Kodak lenses, to the copal shuttered Zeiss glass that has been part of the success of the V-series. It is these cameras, that became known as the <em>V-series</em>, that I'm keen to explore. David makes an important point that resonates with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Good design is discreet and intuitive – if it feels like it should do something then well designed things often do – it’s Mac vs PC for me..."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="cameras-hasselblad-v-the-parts-of-the-system">The parts of the system</h2>
<p>There are separate and distinct parts to the V-system that need to work together to make a camera. The <em>lens</em> attaches to and works with the <em>body</em> to capture light. The body is more than just a box to mount things on to: it houses the controls, the mirror (these are single-lens reflex cameras) and provides the framework for the other system components to interface with. The <em>viewfinder</em> is for the operator to compose the scene with, focusing on the <em>screen</em>. The <em>back</em> captures the image on to film or a digital sensor.</p>

<h2 id="cameras-hasselblad-v-bodies">Bodies</h2>
<p>The 500 series cameras, including the super-wide angle SWx (which have fixed lenses), all have a shutter speed from 1 second to 1/500 s (hence the series name). A leaf shutter is in the lens. Later 2000/200 series bodies revert to a focal plane shutter which can fire at up to 1/2000 s. Those have proved to be less reliable than leaf shutters.</p>
<p>Whilst many reviewers and vloggers have 500 CMs, and I really don't care about flash, the newer models with better mirrors, second shutter coatings and a bright screen seem to be more attractive for a first investment. The newer, slightly larger mirrors in the 503CW and 501CM only make a significant difference with long lenses (in the viewfinder, the older ones have more vignetting). </p>
<h3 id="cameras-hasselblad-v-designations">Designations</h3>
<p>The <strong>C</strong> indicates compur-shutter compatible, and <strong>M</strong> is a <em>modified</em> designation. <strong>CX</strong> and improved <strong>CXi</strong> are TTF/OTF X-sync flash compatible. The SWA super-wide angle bodies are based on the older series one and two cameras (1000 and 1600). On the lenses, F indicates a focal plane shutter with additional letters to indicate compatibility: <strong>FC</strong>, <strong>FCM</strong> and <strong>FCW</strong> are compatible with Compur lenses.</p>
<h2 id="cameras-hasselblad-v-lenses">Lenses</h2>
<p>There is a lot of detail out there on the range of lenses in the V-system, and again, <a href="https://emulsive.org/reviews/camera-reviews/hasselblad-camera-reviews/the-hasselblad-v-system-master-guide-c-and-c-t-star-lenses">Emulsive</a> is your starting point for this. Pertinent details are that most of the lenses are Zeiss glass, with the <strong>C T*</strong> designation indicating multicoatings. The "standard" V-series lens is the Zeiss Planar C 80mm f/2.8, being the diameter of the 56mm square image at the film, and being close to "normal" vision. Some initial preferences for a lens:</p>

<p><strong>C/CT*</strong> lenses are earlier, often found in chrome. They have self-timers and an automatic depth of field indicator (two red marks). C lenses can be used on any V system camera that has interchangeable lenses (i.e. all except the SWC). The <strong>T</strong> indicates multicoating. <em>Note that the 80mm kit C lens sold with the 501C camera is in fact a modified CF lens.</em> Most C/CT* lenses take B50 bayonet filters.</p>
<p><strong>CF</strong> lenses are less "pointy" in appearance and have B60 bayonet filters (because the end of the barrel is wider than the C/CT<em> lenses). The barrel includes hyperfocal distance scales. The </em><em>F</em>* indicates that the lens is compatible with focal plane shutter bodies. Prontor CF shutters are more reliable than Compur Synchro.</p>

<strong>Earthrise</strong> This is the iconic image taken on Christmas Eve, 1968 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Anders">Bill Anders</a> during the Apollo 8 mission, on a Hasselblad EL/M and Zeiss Sonnar f/5.6 250mm lens. The Command Module Hasselblad electric camera was normally fitted with an 80mm f/2.8 Zeiss Planar lens, but a bayonet-mount 250mm lens could be fitted for long-distance Earth/Moon photos (<a href="https://www.history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/02photoequip.html">NASA</a>).

<h2 id="cameras-hasselblad-v-backs">Backs</h2>
<p>Hasselblad have made improvements with each iteration of the film backs: the later type IV backs have a dark slide holder which I imagine will be a very smart thing to have for a system in my hashy hands. If there's a nice safe place to put the dark slide, then I'm less likely to sit on it or drop it in a river. This Hasselblad is going outdoors. <a href="https://kenrockwell.com/hasselblad/a12.htm">Ken Rockwell</a> has a simple guide: there are four generations of A type film magazines ("backs"). There's no functional difference between them.</p>
<h2 id="cameras-hasselblad-v-acquisition">Acquisition</h2>
<p>At best I was looking for a 501 CM or 503 CW with a 42204 screen; an A12 Type IV back; waist-level viewfinder; and <em>preferably</em> a late model 80mm C (CF) Planar lens (although a good early one is OK). Things to watch for:</p>
<ul>
<li>That the body, screen and back are of similar age</li>
<li>Serial numbers of back, roll carrier and dark slide match (last 3 digits)</li>
</ul>
<p>What I settled on was this:</p>

<p>You do have to take your time and do your homework, I am learning. eBay is not usually the right place to buy anything over £100, because it's full of crims and druggies. There are good sellers there, however, including reputable businesses. <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/ebay/index.htm">Ken Rockwell</a>'s guide is right on the money when it comes to evaluating sellers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The seller's feedback rating is a better predictor of the quality of an item than his description of it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ken suggests that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Good feedback ratings are 99.8% and above. Bad feedback ratings are 99.6% and below. Don't even consider buying from anyone with much less of a feedback rating than 99.5%. When I have, I've often gotten junk."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first "proper" camera was a Nikon FM SLR, which I bought second hand around 1977 in Hitchin with a 50mm F1.4 NIKKOR Ai-S lens. I soon after bought a Tamron 80-210mm zoom lens that I used from the 1980s until around 2002 when I boxed it all up and hid it for a few years. I have no idea what happened to the 50mm lens but the body was checked out by <a href="https://www.hlehmann.co.uk/">Lehmanns</a> in 2019 who condemned the shutter mechanism as BER<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cameras-nikon-fm-fn:1">1</a></sup>. </p>
<p>I bought another Nikon FM from <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/secameras">SE Cameras</a> in April 2019 for £90, along with a Nikon AI-s 50mm f/1.8 lens from the same seller for £80. That lens is one of the cheaper E series lenses and I’m not totally happy with the quality of it, so I have bought a Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8 lens on <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/photosound09">eBay</a> for £169. The 28mm and 50mm lenses have a standard 52 mm filter ring.</p>

<strong>The second Nikon FM</strong> at Euston Station</p>
<p>Having had some problems with light leaks with the eBay FM, I took it to <a href="https://www.cameratiks.co.uk/">Cameratiks</a> in Morningside for a CLA, along with my orginial "condemned" FM and the Fuji GW690ii. For a couple of hundred quid, I got not only my "mint" condition eBay bargains back in decent working order, they also manged to return my original FM to full working condition.</p>
<p>In March 2022, under the influence of COVID, I bought a Used Nikon 85mm F1.4 AiS Lens from <a href="https://www.harrisoncameras.co.uk/">Harrison Cameras in Sheffield</a> for £500 inc free P&amp;P. The 85mm lens has a ø of 72 mm. Ordered a lens hood and spare lens cap from a random place on the internet for twenty quid.</p>

<strong>Trøllkonufingur, Faroes</strong> <em>February 2020</em></p>
<p>Ricoh is a brand within the Pentax stable and is well known for the quality of its cameras. I bought a GRIII to have as my "go-anywhere" camera, on the principle that the best camera to have is the one in your hand. It has an 18.3mm focal length lens, which is nicely wide enough to cover almost any opportunity. The sensor is a 24 megapixel APS-C and the camera is fitted with in-body image stabilisation and a fast, clever hybrid contrast and phase detection autofocus system. Like the Fuji X-series mirrorless cameras, it also lacks an anti-aliasing filter on the sensor and thus renders high quality detail.</p>

<strong>Robert Watson-Watt, Brechin</strong>, <em>November 2019</em></p>
<p>The GRIII is built on the brand loyalty established by Ricoh with the earlier compact film cameras and the first two iterations of the digital GR. It has become a favourite of street photographers, so much so that in 2020, they released a special "street" version with a gold lens ring. I lost my original black ring and replaced it with a gold coloured after-market copy so I could be like I am down with the street kids.</p>

<strong>Trælanípan, Faroes</strong>, <em>February 2020</em></p>
<p>The image quality of this little camera always surprises me. It's not that I'm a slow learner, but for the little sensor and tiny lens, the images this portable pocket machine produces are just remarkable. The only problem I have with the camera is that my wife has discovered how good it is. If I could have one camera, and one camera only, I think my GRIII would be it.</p></section><h1 class='nav-section-title-end'>Ended: Cameras</h1>

<p>These pages contain listings of the exposures taken in each roll of film, with details of the camera and exposure settings for each frame, where I noted it at the time. It's really just my reference. Not all of these were scanned, and most of them aren't on this site. Ask if you're particularly interested.</p>
<p>I got out of the habit of pedantically recording every frame setting after about a year of doing it. Once I'd let go of that habit, I lost the opportunity to efficiently learn all of the variables and their influence on the outcome of a capture but hugely improved the enjoyment of photography. It became less neurotic: more art than science: although the science is still there, it's more in the moment. I believe that the process of photography becomes more significant and the reward for me is not so much in the outcomes, although these are sometimes pleasing, as in the creative process itself. That said, I do sometimes take notes, such as when I am on holiday and have plenty of time.</p></section>

<p>I loaded my Nikon FM 6506321 with a roll of Kodak Tri-X 400TX film in September 2021. The roll was exposed with the Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8 lens and a Tiffen Yellow filter #2. I stupidly forgot the camera had film in it, so I opened the back to check. Yes, <em>I opened the back of the camera to check if there was film in it</em>. This is why I can't have nice things.</p>
<p>Eventually, I semi-stand developed it in Rodinal R09 in August 2022.</p>

<!-- To AG for development. -->
<p>I loaded my Nikon FM 2567473 with a roll of Kodak Portra 160 film in February 2022. The roll was exposed with my new-to-me bokeh monster Nikon AI-s 85mm f/1.4 lens. Most of the roll was used during our Easter break to Clach Toll. </p>

<strong>Split Rock Croft, from the adjacent hill</strong></p>
<p>On the road up (we love a road trip), there was, as always, a million amazing sights to see by the side of the road. It gets hard at times to stop safely -- here is the difference between the Pacific NorthWest and Scotland, both incredible places to drive and explore but Scotland has yet to develop its tourist senses. It's quite hostile to all forms of visitor, whether Americans, Japanese Knotweed, or Scots from the central belt. In Washington State, BC and Oregon there are plenty of places to stop and take photographs, camp, barbecue, rest and relax. In Scotland these are situated every 200 miles and have the capacity for 3 vehicles. They Scots will expect you to pay for the privilege too.</p>

<strong>Loch Glascharnoch</strong> from an overused lay-by on the A835 heading North</p>
<p>OK, I'm exaggerating a little but the difference is tangible. North Americans have a lot of space and so can afford to be generous with facilities. They also have a well developed sense of "le weekend", living for it more than we do in the UK, where if you're not doing a 48 hour week, you're not even really interested in your job, are you? </p>

<p>We had a wonderful break at Clach Toll: the split rock landmark marks one of our favourite beaches at any time of year. We were lucky enough to catch one of the last bookings available of the Air B'n'B at Split Rock Croft, before the owners, who had made themselves famous on the BBC's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b094mqlx">"This Farming Life"</a>, closed up and left for pastures new.</p>

<strong>Life</strong></p>
<p>The photos might give a sense of the place, with its private beach below the famous split rock and intimate connection to the environment.</p>

<p>I lost the notes from the final few frames and the film sat in a drawer at home until I sent it to AG for processing and scanning in August. I have not adjusted these images at all, except for resizing for the web. Click on one to get a gallery of the images on the page and try to get a sense of this wonderful place.</p>

<!-- Waiting for development. -->
<p>At the end of the last roll, on the private beach at Split Rock Croft in April 2022, I loaded my Nikon FM 6506321 with another roll of Lomography Babylon 13 black and white film. </p>
<p>The roll was exposed with the Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8 lens and a Tiffen Yellow filter #2.</p>
<p>Still in the camera.</p>

<p>I shot this roll on a winter walk up at the Hermitage in late 2020 but didn't have it developed until early 2021. The exposed roll got "lost" in my disorganised kit bag. We got talking up at Pine Cone Point to a guy flying a drone there who was interested in the big Fuji camera I was toting. It is quite a camera, and seems to be performing well after some TLC, fixing the light leaks.</p>

<strong>The view from Pine Cone Point</strong></p>
<p>I'm learning that I'm not much of a fan of this film stock. I am tempted to touch the white balance more with this film than others. I find it has a blue quality that makes the images seems cold: perhaps it is an acquired taste.</p>

<p>For our summer trip North this year, I took the Hasselblad 503CW and my Nikon FM with digital backup from a Ricoh GRIII and my Fuji X-T2. The Agfa stayed in the bag and the GW690ii stayed at home. There's only so much gear one can carry. This page will not record the digital exposures. The films exposed during the trip were:</p>

<p>These were taken in the Hasselblad in November 2021 and were eventually developed in August 2022 using Rodinal R09 and a semi-stand method. They were scanned on my Epson V600 using their own software, which is clunky but functional enough, and works best, I think, when you switch off the helpful automatic adjustments it claims to be able to do. That said, these are not untouched, although I have tried to not fiddle about with the images in Capture One in the same way I might with a digital capture. Who cares about that? Every photographer in history without AI tools to help has adjusted highlights, shadow, contrast, mid-tone contrast, dodged, burned, cropped or rotated. Those with the AI have done all of that and more without having the bother of thinking about it.</p>

<strong>Tyninghame tree</strong>, Hasselblad 503CW, Zeiss 80mm</p>
<p>When it's not too crowded, the little path to Tyninghame beach is one of my favourite places, not least for the trees along the roadside. This is one of those, set in a pastoral context and a silent witness to the passage of time in this place.</p>

<strong>Bass Rock</strong>, Hasselblad</p>
<p>No less stoic, although a little more decorated by visitors, is Bass Rock in the Forth Estuary, photogenic from every direction.</p>

<strong>Selfie</strong>, Hasselblad</p>
<p>My wife tells me I pull my chin in whenever a photo is taken of me, even when I am the photographer. I will try harder next time but this is my first recent selfie on film.</p>

<p>Black and white negative film, cost £8.00 per roll from Analog Wonderland. Exposed between 4 - 7 Jun 2020 in and around Barkway, Hertfordshire. </p>
<p>I processed this film at home, intending to semi-stand develop in Rodinal R09 one shot, which would have worked out at something like 75p per shot. However, I made a stupid mistake, and reached for the stop solution instead of the developer, resulting in completely blank (transparent) carrier at the end (not even the manufacturer's film markings along the side).</p>

<h2 id="exposures-2020-2020-07-12-bergger-panchro-400-development">Development</h2>
<p>I decided to "semi-stand" develop this film in Rodinal<sup id="fnref:which"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#exposures-2020-2020-07-12-bergger-panchro-400-fn:which">1</a></sup> at 1+99 (in English, 1% solution by volume) for an hour. Stand development means no agitation: solutions must therefore be gently poured into the Paterson tank, to avoid bubbles of air being trapped between the film surfaces. This process is called semi-stand because of the turn half-way through. I followed the recipe kindly posted by <a href="https://geraldo.me.uk/stand-development-with-rodinal-a-guide-based-on-my-own-experience/">Gerald Greenwood</a>. That post is well worth a read and made me laugh out loud. Gerald seems to be a man after my own heart: bored with manly men acting like boys comparing toys, and just wanting good, consistent results.</p>

<h2 id="exposures-2020-2020-07-12-bergger-panchro-400-scanning">Scanning</h2>
<p>Scanning this on an Epson Perfection V600 produces tif images with a Gray (sic) colour space that image processing software can't understand, because they require files to be in RGB colour space. Conversion is easy enough, using <a href="https://imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>:</p>
<p><code>$ magick img20200716_02.tif -set colorspace RGB -type truecolor img20200716_02.tiff</code></p>
<p>This tends to significantly lighten the image, yet the detail is retained in highlights and shadows, and can be adjusted in Capture One.</p>

<p>I destroyed this film in development. I tried to "stand develop" it using Ilfosol 3 developer: this is a quick ("hot") developer, I later discovered, and thus the over-development that resulted (very faded images on the carrier) was not really a surprise in retrospect.</p>
<p>What I'm learning is that you can't "wing it" like that, and expect to keep your images.</p>

<p>Black and white orthochromatic film, cost £12.50 per roll from Analog Wonderland. Loaded 13th July 2020, final frames wasted as I put the camera in for CLA. Used without a filter, which was a stupid mistake. I eventually got the film developed at AG photographic as things got busy and I just couldn't find time to develop this (and other) films myself.</p>
<p>All of the frames in this roll were affected by light leaks but also showed up really bright skies at Clachtoll. This is maybe not surprising, given that the film is orthochromatic and insensitive to red: I probably went with the meter reading in the camera which isn't, and so over exposed the sky. I should have used a filter. I think I also shot too wide and ended up with poor depth of the field for some of the compositions. The Salmon cottage image here took some work with curves in Capture One to get reasonable results.</p>

<strong>Salmon Cottage</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the best images on this film were the ones I ran off of the car in the street: they were much contrastier but showed focus problems beyond about 5 metres. One I didn't touch in post-processing is at the top of this post.</p>

<p>I might try this film again but in better light, and with a yellow filter for the sky.</p>

<!-- 
    I’ve learned that home isn’t a place, it’s a feeling. — Cecelia Ahern #  in Love, Rosie
    A photograph is a secret about a secret. The more it tells you the less you know. — Diane Arbus
    Make visible, what without you, might perhaps never have been seen. ― Robert Bresson

    There are always two people in every picture: the photographer and the viewer. — Ansel Adams
    Bracketing is a sign of insecurity. — Ansel Adams
    You don't take a photograph, you make it. — Ansel Adams
    What the Photograph reproduces to infinity has occurred only once - Roland Barthes
    Photography is an immediate reaction, drawing is a meditation. ― Henri Cartier-Bresson
    Sharpness is a bourgeois concept. ― Henri Cartier-Bresson
    Your first 10,000 photographs are your worst. ― Henri Cartier-Bresson
    If we are the sum of all of our experiences, then who are we if we forget or misremember? ― anon # Actually, Ilenia Dynowski, a candidate for PGDE Art 21 Jan 21.
    Don't shoot what it looks like. Shoot what it feels like. ― David Alan Harvey
    We learn by shooting to see better without a camera. ― Ernst Hass
    The thing is, anybody can be happy and cosy. Nothing good happens in the world by being happy and cosy. — Alex Honnold
    We look at things all the time, but we do not really see them. ― Ibarionex Perello
    All photographs are memento mori. ― Susan Sontag
    Photographs are as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are. ― Susan Sontag
    The painter constructs, the photographer discloses. ― Susan Sontag
    There is an aggression implicit in every use of the camera. ― Susan Sontag
    To photograph someone is a sublimated murder. ― Susan Sontag
    When Cartier-Bresson goes to China, he shows that there are people in China, and that they are Chinese. ― Susan Sontag
    With photography, eclecticism has no limits. ― Susan Sontag
