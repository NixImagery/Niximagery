The people behind that space have weathered the storm of fashion and survive on a hybrid free/subscription based model. The groups and forums on Flickr have been helpful to me so I pay the fee when I can afford it. I recently (July 2022) archived all of the content I had there and am building it up gently to a moderate presence.</p>  <p>Finally, 500px started well but were bought out by a Chinese media company. That killed it for many users, for whom there was a real sense of belonging, especially with the Global Photowalks that 500px got behind -- I am still friends with many of the people I met at the 2015 London event -- but that has also been spoiled by the acquisition. I sustain a free account there, and have noticed a new interest from the people behind the platform in developing their community.

Until recently -- the past decade, perhaps -- I have had a camera to hand if, on the spur of a moment, I needed to capture the scene.

That said, my family were no strangers to photography, and I am lucky enough to have inherited albums of photographs of relatives and their memories. Here is my mother with her grandfather and a chicken: the image connects me to the stories she told of him, and his chickens, and the days she grew up in Letchworth before and during The War. She was a keen follower of the habits of her age and captured moments in her life on still and cine film.

The film is advanced (if you remember2) by winding a knob on the top of the camera body, and the lens shutter is cocked separately (if you remember3).

Most other places had no stock, otherwise I would have rather got it from Wex, which is always a more pleasant experience. The first chance to use it came on our usual run for the hills on New Year's Day, postponed a day this year due to a dinner date with friends on 1st. Weather sealing is built in to this generation of X-T cameras, which offers protection in the environments in which I often photograph. The weather obliged on this trip to Glencoe, ignoring the forecast of clear skies to offer some decent precipitation.</p> <p> We stopped on the way up, at a favourite beach on Loch Lubnaig to capture this view looking to the North. All of the images on this page were taken with the Fuji XF 16mm f/1.4 R WR lens. For depth of field, I stopped down to f/16 to keep the foreground grass reasonably sharp. At ISO400 this meant a shutter speed of 1/30s, something I would not have tried hand-held were it not for the in-built image stabilisation in this camera. I pushed my luck with that idea in the next photo of the waterfall.</p> <p> Cropped, hand-held at 1/15s, f/16 at ISO800.

The \"100\" indicates the 100 megapixel sensor built into that camera but that's only one of the reasons you'd need a camera like that, the other being the \"medium format\" size of the sensor. I've been using the Fuji X system for almost 10 years now and have quite an investment in the glass. My wife is also a Fuji X photographer and the economy of a common lens system in the house makes sense. Carting about over six grand's worth of camera on an icy day in Glencoe does not make sense, even if I could launch that much wonga at a hobby.

Ryan Brenizer's method aims for background blur, or bokeh and works well for that, but renders nice large, printable landscapes when used with a tight aperture. The X-T5 has this available, of course, and I am pleased with the two panoramas taken looking South and West from the Loch Tulla viewpoint on the A82 near Bridge of Orchy. The images here on the website are much reduced, of course, but you can get a sense of the scope by clicking one of them and scrolling.</p> <p> Buachaille Etive M\u00f2r. Tripod, f/16, ISO125, 20 1/8s exposures, pixel-shifted</p> <p>There's a trick new to the X-T5, though, which is pixel shift, in which multiple images are taken and combined using special software into one large image file. The intention is to avoid having to interpolate colours, rendering more accurate colour in the final image. The bonus is that this process can yield much larger resolution in the final image. Other cameras have been able to do this for some time, but the X-T5 is the first in the series to have the capability. This image of Buachaille Etive M\u00f2r used this feature to produce a 100 MPixel square crop.

This blunder might have been mitigated against by the well-known heuristic or rule-of-thumb for expired films stock, which suggests that you should treat the film as being slower by 1 stop for every decade it is out of date.

As long as I remember, she had always been keen, sometimes too keen, to capture a moment in a photograph. I inherited a rich and wonderful collection of albums and shoe-boxes full of family memories, and of quite a lot of people I don't recognise.</p> <p>Amongst her possessions was a little point-and-shoot automatic 35mm camera, a Premier PC-645D. It still had a film in it. I took the camera with me on a couple of trips, including our anniversary weekend to Dunkeld, where we had been married the year before. In some sense, it was a way of making up for her not being able to travel up to Scotland for our wedding: we had taken her the albums of the wedding to see before she was admitted to hospital on Christmas Eve 2019. For a short while this year, it was as if she was with us.</p> <p>Her final pictures were typical. This one, evidence of a mystery. A bungee strap had suddenly appeared with a clatter on the roof of her cottage one day, on the day a stowaway's body was found in a Clapham garden. Mum was convinced that this strap had something to do with it and alerted the authorities, who took no interest. I told her that I thought it entirely feasible that the strap might be connected to the tragedy somehow.</p> <p> Bungee from the sky</p> <p>The second is of three visitors to her little house in Letchworth, Michelle, Marilyn and Tracey, cousins on the Brennan side (my grandmother's). Mum often had visitors; Michelle wrote of this visit:</p>   <p>I lost her phone number and we just went unannounced, but she still made us welcome. I'm so grateful we decided to go anyway as this was to be the last time we saw her. Letchworth captured my heart, and from the first time I went with my mum to re-unite with the cousins Audreys, I absolutely adored your mum, such a beautiful and fascinating lady. I will never forget all her advice, she taught me so much that I didn't know about our family on the Brennan side, especially the ones that emigrated to Canada.</p>  <p> Three visitors</p> <p>We took a trip along the coast near us, to Crail. Here's my wife at work, and the kind of place mum would have enjoyed being if she were able to travel. Her health wasn't the best, it never had been, but she never offered it as an excuse or let it prevent her from living the most fruitful and interesting life. The crashing waves on this rocky coast would have been right up her street.</p> <p> Crail</p> <p>Finally, on the weekend to Dunkeld, I took a selfie for mum of my wife and I in the mirror in our suite, not taking into account the flash on this little point-and-shoot, \"focus free\" camera.

We couldn't go to the Moon to shoot with this iconic camera, so we slogged it to the top of a local hill on a very chilly winter morning. </p> <p>It was a crampon day, according to a chap we passed on the walk to Glenquey reservoir where our ascent started. He seemed confident enough on the icy path back down so we took it to be banter. As it turned out, we might have benefited from crampons as we took what turned out to be a harder route up the hill. We had poles, and wouldn't have completed the climb without them for sure.</p> <p>I \"stand\" processed the film in Rodinal 1:100 for 60 minutes. The film was quite curly when it dried, so I cut it into strips and put it in a book2 for half an hour before scanning. Very quickly, as I scanned, a more serious issue presented itself. </p> <p> The first image from Innerdownie Hill.</p> <p>Here, we see a light leak, which comes from the left hand side of the film magazine as seen when shooting. This is disappointing, but I am assured by the very helpful and supportive community of Hasselblad film photographers that this is to be expected when buying an old camera. A proper inspection is required by people experienced in such things, and fortunately, I know of such people not far from where I live that can do that. </p>  <p>There is some question about whether I introduced problems during development, but I don't think so, having used this method before without problem. If it had been a development issue, then the banding might have gone the other way (and appeared at the bottom of the frame). I am not confident I can explain the second (central vertical) stripe in the above image. There were two images on the roll with marks like this, and so there may have been something I didn't do quite right in development. Another roll might help confirm this.</p>  <p>The variation in that flare on the right of each frame differs according to the shutter speed used. The longer exposures (such as the 1-second river image below) suffer with a greater effect, whereas in the short exposures (header image, 1/500s at f/22) it is less obvious.</p> <p> River, from the bridge 1 second at f/11</p> <p>Am I disappointed? Well, yes, of course, but perhaps my expectations weren't reasonable. The camera and magazine are just over 20 years old and I have no idea what kind of life they have led. The lens is over 50 years old. It should be expected to have old equipment, used or not, well cared for or not, checked over properly before it functions as it should.</p> <p>There is some consolation, in that I can recover enough in post processing to render a reasonable image. It's cheating a bit, maybe, but Ansel Adams put a lot of effort into working up his negatives into a decent print.

Most of the snowscape shots were taken at f/11, 1/125s, which is over the suggested f/22, 1/500s for Bright/Hazy Sun on Light Sand or Snow. I used my Nikon FM as a meter on the hill but quite possibly this is an unreliable witness: it had a number 8 yellow filter for which I had compensated 1/3 stop but the TriX data sheet suggests 2 stops for this filter. Next time, I'll use my digital camera for metering. About old cameras It is to be expected that older equipment needs to be maintained and looked after. If buying second hand, assume that inspection and sevice by an experienced technician is needed before you will get the best out of the investment, and budget for it. About stand developing Film manufacturers produce data sheets that are worth following until you have enough experience to vary. There are situations where stand development is a good idea: perhaps where individual frames have been pushed. Reduced grain can be had also, but it doesn't (and shouldn't) compensate for bad focusing.

Obviously right down at f/22 and 1/1000s of a second, but still produced a flare at the top of the image (which I cropped out). Who points a camera at the sun?</p> <p>What I am finding is that I am preferring medium format for no other reason than it takes forever to finish a roll of 36 frames. If it's a colour film, it can be literally months between closing the shutter and seeing the result, by which time my photography has moved on, or at least, I've forgotten what I was thinking at the time. It's as if I become detached from the image: quite the reverse of my intention in returning to film. Perhaps I ought to up my game a bit: perhaps I'm over diverse. On most of our recent outings, I've had at least three cameras with me. I don't think this is helping me much. </p> <p> Lower Largo. I like the sky.</p> <p>Accurate metering still evades me, but I feel I am getting a clearer understanding of this: I've started Ansel Adams' The Negative in which he describes his Zone System for proper evaluation of a frame.

It's almost pastel: I think it's probably more suited to brighter light than I have exposed it in this roll, which are mostly wintery scenes, most recently taken on a walk out at Glenquey reservoir. The top image, of trees at Glendevon in the snow, gains very little from the colours of Portra, for example.</p> <p> Bridge at Glendevon. White balance adjusted from the scanner's default in Capture One. A bit more Portra-like, in my view.</p> <p>Another aspect of this workflow that is bothering me is what the scanner assumes in the process. The colours and contrast often seem unimpressive. I can't tell if it's me or the device: I'm assuming it's me at the moment, because I want to not overdo the post-processing.

I bought some 135 and 120 from Analog Wonderland for \u00a37 and \u00a38 per roll, respectively. The first roll went through my Hassleblad with not too much success and I promised then not to stand develop this film next time.</p> <p>Well, that's all well and good but the exposures I made with both my Nikon FM and the Agfa Isolette were \"empirical\" and in variable light. Because of this, I semi-stand developed these in the hope that the development principle of this method might compensate for variable metering.</p> <p> Innerdownie Hill, Nikon FM. Compare with the similar image taken on my Hasselblad.</p> <p>The first few frames of the roll taken in the Nikon FM were exposed up Innerdownie Hill. I had a No. 8 Yellow filter that ought to have about 2 stops of compensation applied to it, but I stupidly adjusted the ISO on the camera's meter. Think about it -- this camera has TTL or through-the lens metering. That means that the meter reads the light inside the camera after it has passed through the filter. It already compensates for the filter's attenuation, so you don't have to. This is one reason why semi-stand development was used for this film: I realised I had blundered on the metering.</p> <p> Glenquey reservoir</p> <p>I've learned not to take myself too seriously as a photographer. There are many, many better photographers than me, so I don't get the rage when things don't work out, except at myself when I continually fail to learn a lesson. Occasionally, though, I'll try something I haven't before, and the top image shows an attempt at \"ICM\", or intentional camera movement. This has been used by some artists to convey emotion or a feeling, and I think my version has a sense of what it felt like to be in the woods on that snowy day. I'm pleased with it, anyway: it was consciously done, knowing that it was too dark for a hand-held capture, and that the mossy mound I had chosen for a makeshift tripod was just too mossy to be useful, it was a case of either not taking the photo, or pausing for a moment to connect to the feeling of it. I thought ICM might do it: I think it it did.</p> <p> by Glenquey sluice</p> <p>I scanned these after developing and then pulled them into Capture One for adjustment. Cropping and rotation are first, usually. Cropping, because the negative carrier Epson supplies with the scanner is pretty flimsy and difficult to use. Rotation is often required because I am rubbish at keeping a horizon level (ask anyone who flew with me in the days I had a pilot's licence). Adjustment is necessary beyond this, because I didn't let the scanner do anything by way of exposure adjustment or colour rendering -- I am hoping that it just scans the negatives into a file containing all of the information in the film and doesn't try to do any thinking for me.</p> <p> Loch Leven</p> <p>Other adjustments in Capture One include the standard set of looking at the levels and mid-tone contrast, and maybe removing dust specks (I'm not at the white cotton-glove stage of handling my negatives). Here is where I notice persistent problems: in the Nikon, I am noticing metering inconsistencies, or at least errors with extended use in cold weather. Perhaps I have relied heavily on the meter inside this camera too much, which has resulted in some disappointments, this roll included, when ambient light levels are low.

The schedule can be challenging so I always try to arrive around 20 minutes early so as to check any messages, and enter the school with grace and dignity. On this cycle of visits, I thought I'd use the extra time to also practice some sketching.</p> <p> Linlithgow Academy</p> <p>There is a rationale for this habit. Sketching is a deliberate, mindful process, even when done quickly. It helps you see what is there, and the looking doesn't stop when the sketchbook is closed. At Linlithgow, I found myself studying wall displays, people, the dynamic of school reception spaces, looking at shapes and patterns as much as inscriptions. I even got the chance to assist some not-yet-detective material police officers in their hunt for the reception desk, being able to indicate the huge sign that my fine-tuned sketcher's observational skills had spotted in the lobby.</p>  <p> Deans Community High School</p>  <p>We continue to invest in building new schools to replace older, more out of date infrastructure. This is a good thing for many reasons including sending a message to the country that education is important and valuable to us all. Whilst every school is different, certain design features and material choices appear in many of the recent builds, perhaps dating them. This is not to say they look the same -- they do, in some respects, but each has its own features according to the perceived needs of the community they serve.</p>  <p> Kirkcaldy High School</p>  <p>I taught Physics and Mathematics at Kirkcaldy High School for a number of years before replacing my own tutor at Moray House. I'm not going to reminisce about this old place but it was nice to go back for a visit and see friends and former colleagues again. I was reminded that cultures are slow to change and that whilst rolling stones may gather no moss, they do gather experience you don't get standing still.</p> <p>Bunsen burners, magnesium strips and good dialogic pedagogy made my job easy at Preston Lodge today. All the nicer to see more old friends, too. Education is a village, and once you've been at it a while, it can feel like going home when you meet again, people who have shared different parts of your journey. Conversations pick up where they left off, friendship hugs shock the pupils, and mutual respect is grown and shared from stories of careers unfolding. I love it when new teachers see that: they are enculturated into their vocation through the modelled behaviours of those that go before them, and shape them. There's more to this than Vygotksy, or Bruner, or the latest educational fad.</p>  <p> Preston Lodge High School</p>   <p> Portobello High School</p>  <p>Preston Lodge and Portobello sketches are not the best likeness to the real thing, for similar reasons. At Preston Lodge, my view from the car was obscured by a large van and so I had to interpret and sketch what I felt was there. Isn't that the point, though? The American photographer David Alan Harvey said, \"Don't shoot what it looks like. Shoot what it feels like.\" This is my motivation in photography as much as in sketching, and exploring that idea is the principal reason for me wanting to sketch more often. At Portobello, a different large van also obscured the view, and I don't have the confidence quite to stand in a car park sketching, in full view of the CCTV. I had a call to go in to school anyway, so I took a quick photo on my phone and sketched it up later in a caf\u00e9 over lunch. From this experience, I think I do a better job sketching live, en plein air, than from a photo. Something seems to be missing in my drawing from a photo, at least where my skills are at present. Perhaps that will change with practice.</p> <p> The lorry at Leith, with a fast rat</p> <p>Leith Academy has a nice front fa\u00e7ade but you can't see it from where I parked, and the back of the building is ugly, so I sketched the random lorry in the car park instead. I did not find out what the vehicle does, or why it's there, but it looks arty to me, even if it seems past its best service days. Leith has always felt like an arty school: it has interesting shaped science labs which are full of scope and character, even if some of the electrical infrastructure also seems past its best service days. The teachers are anything but, of course, nor the businesslike head teacher who introduced himself as I was preparing to leave for my next appointment. It's great that there are schools like Leith who put the effort and investment into new teachers, for the wider good of Scottish education. </p>  <p> Musselburgh Grammar School</p>  <p>There is a quid pro quo, of course, in the benefit that mentors and other colleagues get from watching rookies make na\u00efve mistakes and offering guidance and advice from experience, at the same time tapping in to new ideas and reconnecting to the principles of pedagogy that are fresh in the student teachers' thinking. This was articulated in both schools I visited today by the supporting teachers who played their important part in bringing about fair and just evaluation of how their charges have progressed.</p>  <p> Queensferry CHS, in the fog</p>  <p>There was a thick fog for my journey across the Forth to Queensferry and I almost bottled doing the sketch because I don't know how to draw fog. I had a word with myself and thought, \"just put the pen marks where it's dark, and don't put them where it's light\". Easier said than, done, I think, so I diverted myself by trying to capture a couple of figures approaching the pool of light from the lamp. I remember a sketcher artist I follow said that figures add interest to a sketch. I think they are right, but I prefer the Leith rat, if I'm honest.</p>  <p> Deans CHS again</p>  <p>Back to Deans again and a view from a different part of the car park. It's interesting how varied these buildings can look, depending on where you look from. My wife calls my style \"Roobarb\", for the unsteady hand that wiggles the lines. I did get an 'O' level many years ago in technical drawing, so I do know how to use a ruler but when I'm trying to work quickly -- none of these sketches took more than about 10 minutes -- the look is more one of impression than technical accuracy. I was conscious that I was cold sitting in the car at Deans and so the lines were more Roobarb than usual, perhaps. More figure suggestions, though, and they seem to be growing on me. I'm quite pleased with the silver birch, too, given that I'm not giving myself time to make 10,000 strokes for the leaves.</p> <p> Dingwall</p> <p>A long but pleasant drive up beyond Inverness took me to new territory, and once more found me shaking hands with colleagues who had passed through my tutorials at Moray House. It's lovely to see the products of my labour thriving and making their mark on young people across the country. I am taking all the credit, of course, as I will for the superb teacher whose lesson on nuclear fission was one of the best I have ever seen. It's not all me, of course: a lot of work goes in to becoming a teacher, especially a good one, and you have to bring a lot of things, too. Attitude, aptitude, wit, intelligence, humour, resilience, just to mention a few. Those who bring all of that with them perhaps don't need much from me to succeed, but I do like to tell myself that I help them excel.</p>  <p> Broxburn Academy</p>  <p>As the weeks of touring schools come to an end for this session at least, I feel that I have been inspired by students, colleagues and the young people in schools. The student teachers have a steep learning curve, especially on their first school placement. Workload can be an issue, and both schools and the university urge the students to try to find a good, healthy, sustainable balance. I asked some of them what their \"secret\" is for managing this. All said that the balance is crucial to survival, and that part of that is remaining physically active through sport or exercise. Some of them run; others swim or play a sport. This advice I took myself today by going for a run in the early morning darkness. </p> <p>Vehicles are often a challenge for schools at the beginning and end of the day, even more so when parking is limited, so the final visit of the tour found me arriving at my destination later than planned. I parked in a quiet residential area and enjoyed a walk through the catchment instead of having time to sketch. By now, I was thinking that although every school is different, I had probably sketched enough fairly-recently-built school buildings to have a good appreciation for their character. </p>","tags":["Sketch"]},{"location":"Stories/2022/2022-12-24-dunkeld/","title":"Dunkeld Christmas preparation","text":"<p>Earlier in the year, we booked a dinner-bed-and-breakfast deal for Christmas Eve's eve, as much for corporeal as spiritual health. Before he knew what was happening, the cat was dropped at his aunties' place and we were in our favourite winter woodland. The intention was to unwind on the approach to Christmas Day; to hit pause on the processes of work, study, shopping and the rest. It worked a charm. We didn't book the suite we had when we were married at the Dunkeld House Hotel but our room was enough for the purpose. </p> <p> The Hermitage Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4 lens. </p> <p>There was plenty of time to enjoy a slow wander around the Hermitage before check-in. We took cameras, but not the usual paraphernalia of tripods and filters. Very soon, the life-giving oxygen of the trees respiring reached our lungs and Mother Nature cwtched us both. That feeling never gets old and before long we were on speaking terms with the residents again. </p>       <p>Notices seem to have discouraged the previously trending habit of visitors forcing coins into any tree stump. Like most popular excesses, it's neither healthy nor tasteful, like those repetitive memes you see. I'm glad the coin habit seems to be on the wane, even if the endless banality of social media is anything but. Oh, look, there's yet another New Year's resolution. </p> <p>The soundscape on a walk around the Hermitage trail is varied, especially in the winter when the River Braan is swollen with meltwater from the recent snow. I didn't record it: it's white noise in a browser. Perhaps the picture will help you hear the rushing of the whitewater over rocks on the fall by Ossian's Hall.</p>     <p>On the other side of the A9, the Tay wanders beside the hotel, altogether a more dignified spectacle than the its manic neighbour, the Braan. Alongside that river is the \"dookit\" or stone structure where we were married in the gentle Pertshire rainfall, with poetry and music and prayer. We walked down to remind ourselves and renew the feelings of that day. It was beautiful, of course. </p> <p>So, now, I write this on the \"other side\" of the Christmas celebrations we were preparing ourselves for; the joys and excesses, catechisms and exchanges of gifts, avoided topics, revelations and ghosts of those departed. That one night away, to worship in the cathedral of nature, to enjoy someone else cooking, to be ourselves for ourselves, was not only the perfect preparation for the bacchanalian feast, but also a shahada for the year ahead.</p> <p> Nature's Cathedral Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4 lens. </p>","tags":["Fuji X-T2"]},{"location":"tags/","title":"Index","text":"<p>Henri Cartier-Bresson</p> <p>Your
