Until recently -- the past decade, perhaps -- I have had a camera to hand if, on the spur of a moment, I needed to capture the scene. In the 20th century, it was a lot less usual for there to be a serendipidous camera available: the act of photography was more deliberate, usually requiring planning of some kind. That said, my family were no strangers to photography, and I am lucky enough to have inherited albums of photographs of relatives and their memories. Here is my mother with her grandfather and a chicken: the image connects me to the stories she told of him, and his chickens, and the days she grew up in Letchworth before and during The War. She was a keen follower of the habits of her age and captured moments in her life on still and cine film. She gave me my first camera, an Ilford, but I never really learned how to use it. A proper camera A proper aeroplane. De Havilland Beaver, Ex. Pond Jump West, Canada, 1980. My first \"proper\" camera was a Nikon FM SLR , which I bought second hand around 1977 in Hitchin with a 50mm lens. I soon after bought a Tamron 80-210mm zoom lens that I used from the 1980s until around 2002 when I boxed it all up and hid it for a few years. I returned to making film photographs after a long break, and a few years shooting digital. Back in the (digital) habit I got back into the habit of taking photographs, starting with a couple of forgettable, probably Canon, point-and-shoots, and then a Canon \"Powershot\" bridge camera. It wasn't long before I was frustrated by the limitations of these consumer products, designed as they are to protect the consumer from himself by idiot-proofing (like that now featuring in modern cars). I hate it when machines try to do the thinking. They're rubbish at it. Hagia Sofia Fuji X-E2 with the kit lens After some extensive research and evaluation of cameras available within a reasonable budget (otherwise I'd have just bought a Hasselblad), I fell upon the Fuji X range of cameras. I don't care what anyone says, these are by far the very best mid-priced digital cameras, because: the glass is superb the sensors are superb the development commitment is superb the lack of anti-aliasing filters There are other reasons, of course, but these were enough for me. I bought an X-E2 with the 18-55mm kit lens and took it everywhere. I replaced it when the 24 Megapixel sensor came out, with the X-T2 , which is as close as I could find in the Fuji X range to the Nikon FM SLR format I know and am comfortable with. Killiecrankie Fuji X-T2 with the XF16mmF1.4 R WR lens I've never regretted it: the camera makes great images. With modern post-processing tools, I can construct really nice images from the RAW files.

Film cameras My wife and I were out taking photos on a frosty morning at the end of 2019 when we met a chap in the woods with a boxy-looking camera with a waist level viewfinder. This turned out to be a Hasselblad 500 of some kind and I asked him quite a lot of questions about medium format film photography. He had bought his camera at Ffordes in Inverness and I bought a dose of GAS 1 from him. After a fair bit of reading and research, I decided I wanted to give medium format a try. Sisters These were the film cameras I was using at the start of 2020. This lasted for a couple of years, and you can read the various stories here on the site, including my acquisition of knowledge and experience in exchange for hard cash.

I will regret it, of course, I still ache for my old Rickenbacker, but it's making images that I love, not exposing film to be processed when I have the time, often months later.

That said, my family were no strangers to photography, and I am lucky enough to have inherited albums of photographs of relatives and their memories. Here is my mother with her grandfather and a chicken: the image connects me to the stories she told of him, and his chickens, and the days she grew up in Letchworth before and during The War.

Introduction and the cost of Hasselblads My wife and I met a guy one frosty morning, out in the countryside with a Hasselblad while his other half was at a car boot sale. He had bought the camera but was unable to tell his wife. I am more fortunate, and my wife is not averse to me owning a Hasselblad but we are both educators and not that flush, so a little humility and frugality is in order. She has helped me be smart and not so impulsive, and had me talk her through the due diligence and research I have done since that first GAS 1 attack a year ago. That said, I have had encouragement in my desire to own a Hasselblad camera system: do it ; - ) \u2014 Dr David Mitchell (@DSM888) December 2, 2020 The piece I refer to in that Tweet is David's personal reflection on the Japan Camera Hunter blog, in which he sketches the history of Hasselblad and his own passion for the brand. In that post, David describes the development of the cameras from the early models with focal plane shutters and Kodak lenses, to the copal shuttered Zeiss glass that has been part of the success of the V-series. It is these cameras, that became known as the V-series , that I'm keen to explore. David makes an important point that resonates with me: \"Good design is discreet and intuitive \u2013 if it feels like it should do something then well designed things often do \u2013 it\u2019s Mac vs PC for me...\" The parts of the system There are separate and distinct parts to the V-system that need to work together to make a camera. The lens attaches to and works with the body to capture light. The body is more than just a box to mount things on to: it houses the controls, the mirror (these are single-lens reflex cameras) and provides the framework for the other system components to interface with. The viewfinder is for the operator to compose the scene with, focusing on the screen . The back captures the image on to film or a digital sensor. 500 series timeline Production Model Notes 1957 -- 1970 500 C Original Compur leaf-shutter 1970 -- 1994 500 CM User-changeable screen 1988 -- 1994 503 CX Built-in TTL flash meter, \u201cPalpas\u201d shutter coating, improved Acute Matte screen 1994 -- 1997 501 C Complete kit, A12 magazine, 80mm lens 1997 -- 2005 501 CM The best Acute Matte D screen, CW winder, better internal coatings 1996 -- 2013 503 CW Improved mirror system Bodies The 500 series cameras, including the super-wide angle SWx (which have fixed lenses), all have a shutter speed from 1 second to 1/500 s (hence the series name). A leaf shutter is in the lens. Later 2000/200 series bodies revert to a focal plane shutter which can fire at up to 1/2000 s. Those have proved to be less reliable than leaf shutters. Whilst many reviewers and vloggers have 500 CMs, and I really don't care about flash, the newer models with better mirrors, second shutter coatings and a bright screen seem to be more attractive for a first investment. The newer, slightly larger mirrors in the 503CW and 501CM only make a significant difference with long lenses (in the viewfinder, the older ones have more vignetting). Designations The C indicates compur-shutter compatible, and M is a modified designation. CX and improved CXi are TTF/OTF X-sync flash compatible. The SWA super-wide angle bodies are based on the older series one and two cameras (1000 and 1600). On the lenses, F indicates a focal plane shutter with additional letters to indicate compatibility: FC , FCM and FCW are compatible with Compur lenses. Lenses There is a lot of detail out there on the range of lenses in the V-system, and again, Emulsive is your starting point for this. Pertinent details are that most of the lenses are Zeiss glass, with the C T* designation indicating multicoatings. The \"standard\" V-series lens is the Zeiss Planar C 80mm f/2.8, being the diameter of the 56mm square image at the film, and being close to \"normal\" vision. Some initial preferences for a lens: Name f Max Min Usage Filter Shutter Distagon 50mm f/4 f/22 Landscape 63 mm Compur Synchro Distagon 60mm f/3.5 f/22 Landscape B60 Compur Synchro Planar C 80mm f/2.8 f/22 General B60 Compur Syncro Planar CF 80mm f/2.8 f/22 General B50 Prontor CF Planar 100mm f/3.5 f/22 Tele, high resolution B50 Compur Synchro Sonnar C 150mm f/4 f/32 Portrait B50 Compur Synchro Sonnar C 250mm f/5.6 f/45 Portrait B50 Compur Synchro Tele-Tessar C 350mm f/5.6 f/45 Tele B50 Compur Synchro C/CT* lenses are earlier, often found in chrome. They have self-timers and an automatic depth of field indicator (two red marks). C lenses can be used on any V system camera that has interchangeable lenses (i.e. all except the SWC). The T indicates multicoating. Note that the 80mm kit C lens sold with the 501C camera is in fact a modified CF lens. Most C/CT* lenses take B50 bayonet filters. CF lenses are less \"pointy\" in appearance and have B60 bayonet filters (because the end of the barrel is wider than the C/CT lenses). The barrel includes hyperfocal distance scales. The F * indicates that the lens is compatible with focal plane shutter bodies. Prontor CF shutters are more reliable than Compur Synchro. Earthrise This is the iconic image taken on Christmas Eve, 1968 by Bill Anders during the Apollo 8 mission, on a Hasselblad EL/M and Zeiss Sonnar f/5.6 250mm lens. The Command Module Hasselblad electric camera was normally fitted with an 80mm f/2.8 Zeiss Planar lens, but a bayonet-mount 250mm lens could be fitted for long-distance Earth/Moon photos ( NASA ). See also Wex's and NASA 's articles on the Apollo 11 cameras. Backs Hasselblad have made improvements with each iteration of the film backs: the later type IV backs have a dark slide holder which I imagine will be a very smart thing to have for a system in my hashy hands. If there's a nice safe place to put the dark slide, then I'm less likely to sit on it or drop it in a river. This Hasselblad is going outdoors. Ken Rockwell has a simple guide: there are four generations of A type film magazines (\"backs\"). There's no functional difference between them. Acquisition At best I was looking for a 501 CM or 503 CW with a 42204 screen; an A12 Type IV back; waist-level viewfinder; and preferably a late model 80mm C (CF) Planar lens (although a good early one is OK). Things to watch for: That the body, screen and back are of similar age Serial numbers of back, roll carrier and dark slide match (last 3 digits) What I settled on was this: Back Body Lens VF Screen A12 IV SS 00 503CW EU 97 80mm F2.8 C 67 WL Acute Matte You do have to take your time and do your homework, I am learning. eBay is not usually the right place to buy anything over \u00a3100, because it's full of crims and druggies. There are good sellers there, however, including reputable businesses. Ken Rockwell 's guide is right on the money when it comes to evaluating sellers: \"The seller's feedback rating is a better predictor of the quality of an item than his description of it.\" Ken suggests that: \"Good feedback ratings are 99.8% and above. Bad feedback ratings are 99.6% and below. Don't even consider buying from anyone with much less of a feedback rating than 99.5%. When I have, I've often gotten junk.\" I'm stoked to own my own Hasselblad camera: 2021 is looking to be a good year already.

She has helped me be smart and not so impulsive, and had me talk her through the due diligence and research I have done since that first GAS 1 attack a year ago. That said, I have had encouragement in my desire to own a Hasselblad camera system: do it ; - ) \u2014 Dr David Mitchell (@DSM888) December 2, 2020 The piece I refer to in that Tweet is David's personal reflection on the Japan Camera Hunter blog, in which he sketches the history of Hasselblad and his own passion for the brand. In that post, David describes the development of the cameras from the early models with focal plane shutters and Kodak lenses, to the copal shuttered Zeiss glass that has been part of the success of the V-series. It is these cameras, that became known as the V-series , that I'm keen to explore. David makes an important point that resonates with me: \"Good design is discreet and intuitive \u2013 if it feels like it should do something then well designed things often do \u2013 it\u2019s Mac vs PC for me...\"","title":"Introduction and the cost of Hasselblads"},{"location":"Cameras/hasselblad-v/#the-parts-of-the-system","text":"There are separate and distinct parts to the V-system that need to work together to make a camera. The lens attaches to and works with the body to capture light. The body is more than just a box to mount things on to: it houses the controls, the mirror (these are single-lens reflex cameras) and provides the framework for the other system components to interface with. The viewfinder is for the operator to compose the scene with, focusing on the screen . The back captures the image on to film or a digital sensor.","title":"The parts of the system"},{"location":"Cameras/hasselblad-v/#500-series-timeline","text":"Production Model Notes 1957 -- 1970 500 C Original Compur leaf-shutter 1970 -- 1994 500 CM User-changeable screen 1988 -- 1994 503 CX Built-in TTL flash meter, \u201cPalpas\u201d shutter coating, improved Acute Matte screen 1994 -- 1997 501 C Complete kit, A12 magazine, 80mm lens 1997 -- 2005 501 CM The best Acute Matte D screen, CW winder, better internal coatings 1996 -- 2013 503 CW Improved mirror system","title":"500 series timeline"},{"location":"Cameras/hasselblad-v/#bodies","text":"The 500 series cameras, including the super-wide angle SWx (which have fixed lenses), all have a shutter speed from 1 second to 1/500 s (hence the series name). A leaf shutter is in the lens. Later 2000/200 series bodies revert to a focal plane shutter which can fire at up to 1/2000 s. Those have proved to be less reliable than leaf shutters. Whilst many reviewers and vloggers have 500 CMs, and I really don't care about flash, the newer models with better mirrors, second shutter coatings and a bright screen seem to be more attractive for a first investment. The newer, slightly larger mirrors in the 503CW and 501CM only make a significant difference with long lenses (in the viewfinder, the older ones have more vignetting).","title":"Bodies"},{"location":"Cameras/hasselblad-v/#designations","text":"The C indicates compur-shutter compatible, and M is a modified designation.

Pertinent details are that most of the lenses are Zeiss glass, with the C T* designation indicating multicoatings. The \"standard\" V-series lens is the Zeiss Planar C 80mm f/2.8, being the diameter of the 56mm square image at the film, and being close to \"normal\" vision.

They have self-timers and an automatic depth of field indicator (two red marks). C lenses can be used on any V system camera that has interchangeable lenses (i.e. all except the SWC). The T indicates multicoating. Note that the 80mm kit C lens sold with the 501C camera is in fact a modified CF lens. Most C/CT* lenses take B50 bayonet filters. CF lenses are less \"pointy\" in appearance and have B60 bayonet filters (because the end of the barrel is wider than the C/CT lenses). The barrel includes hyperfocal distance scales. The F * indicates that the lens is compatible with focal plane shutter bodies. Prontor CF shutters are more reliable than Compur Synchro.

Stand development means no agitation: solutions must therefore be gently poured into the Paterson tank, to avoid bubbles of air being trapped between the film surfaces. This process is called semi-stand because of the turn half-way through. I followed the recipe kindly posted by Gerald Greenwood . That post is well worth a read and made me laugh out loud.

The camera has a fixed 90mm f/3.5 lens and takes 6 cm x 9 cm frames, or 8 per roll of 120. I sent them all to be processed by AG Labs. Day 1 LRPS Well, the good news came by email around 12:40 from Simon Vercoe, the LRPS admin assistant at the Royal Photographic Society, that I am finally to be awarded the distinction of \"Licentiate\" of the RPS. I'm delighted about that, of course. More on that story here . Travelling by plane with film We are on board a flight from Edinburgh to V\u00e1gar, the capital of the Faroe Islands. I have my Fuji GW690ii medium format camera with me and a stock of 9 film rolls that hopefully haven't been ruined by the airport security scan at Edinburgh. Despite my protests, the security people scanned all of the unexposed film. We'll see if there is any effect on the stock 2 . I think the greatest danger to the film still lies in my photographic skills. Airbus , iPhone 11 4.25mm lens at ISO 125. f/1.8 1/84s.

The first film I loaded into the camera was one of the rolls of Kodak TMY, aka T-Max 400 and fitted a deep yellow Tiffen filter. Why that one? It's the one I have. Why a filter? We're going to be focusing on landscapes and I want to try not to wreck the skies: the yellow will darken the bluer highlights in the sky and reveal the cloud texture. You can see how this turned out in the above image which was taken later that morning. As it turned out, this was the only roll of this film stock that saw the light of day on this trip 1 .

All around the islands and in these communities are signs reminding visitors of the importance of respect for the environment, the creatures that live here and the people. One of the striking features of this place is the black sand beach. The black sands at B\u00f8ur beach Portra My first efforts with Portra. I think we might have been too far North for this film, which seems to be more at home nearer the Equator. I exposed this film during the rest of day 2 and the following morning.

Giljavegur f/16 1/60s Sandav\u00e1gur, hand held Digital backup I finished that roll of TMY at B\u00f8ur on the beach, and backed up the captures using the Ricoh GRIII I carry everywhere, and my Fuji X-T2 fitted with the brilliant Fuji 16mm f/1.4 prime lens. I wondered whether the sun was too low in the sky for the Portra film (Miami, this ain't) but the film worked out really nicely, in my view. Gasadalur The best image of the day has been a 3-photo stitch of the village Gasadalur from the bench at a hairpin bend in the road looking west towards the helipad that was the only outside communication link for the community before the road was built. This is a 3-image stitch panorama taken with a Fuji X-T2, using the XF16mm F1.4 R WR lens. ISO 400, f/11, 1/60s. Later - re-scanning I re-scanned a couple of these images to see if the output quality was any better. It is, depending on how you measure it. This is a (reduced version of the scanner output) 350 Mega-pixel file, scanned from 6x9cm negative at 6400 dpi: Island (Re-scan of frame 5, Portra) If you compare the quality of image I got with the Fuji X-T2 (Gasadalur, above), there really is no argument for film photography, based upon these results. Now, I know that medium format cameras capture a lot of information, but that depends on a lot of things being exactly right. Get more than a couple of parameters sub-optimal and you're wasting your time striving for that Nirvana of image-making. To me, the important difference is how it feels. Day 3 Seal at Sandav\u00e1gur (cropped) Fuji X-T2, XF90mm F2 R LM WR, ISO 800, f/2 1/500s Reflections Studying the local guide map over coffee and a biscuit, I realise how ignorant I feel about the place and culture I am in. This, as a consequence of the pace of life I am leading, ironically to pay for the privilege of travel. I will no doubt go home full of resolutions to do something about this, which will be dragged into the quicksand of daily hustle and bustle, leaving only the guilt as trace that I ever made them. Sandav\u00e1gur We drove down to Sandav\u00e1gur for the sunrise, which was wintery. Kara played with waves and the seals and I took a photo of the floodlit church which didn't turn out the way I hoped. This is the church, taken the next day with Fuji Pro 400H. Sandav\u00e1gur Church Fuji Pro 400H, second roll, frame 2 Tr\u00f8llkonufingur We drove to the Witch's Finger (Tr\u00f8llkonufingur) and walked along far enough to see the stack and promised to return to catch the sun rising here tomorrow. Tr\u00f8llkonufingur Fuji Pro 400H, post processed in Iridient T\u00f3rshavn After a good breakfast we headed for the Streymoy tunnel and T\u00f3rshavn, where we ate extremely expensive sushi. One of the delights of the Faroes is that they have not learned how to do tourism yet, with its expected levels of service. Certainly our waitress hadn't done the course. I'm not complaining - it's nice to have the feeling that you're not just following in the footsteps of 80 million people before you, taking the same photos. I didn't take many photos in the town: it's nice, and there is a harbour and some old buildings but it was raining and I was happy just experiencing the place. Fuji Pro 400H exposures I used 2 rolls of Fuji Pro 400H in different contexts: starting with the Tr\u00f8llkonufingur, the town of T\u00f3rshavn, and at Gasadalur, the iconic lake over the sea.

Acros B\u00f8sdalafossur We went out for sunrise at the Witch's Finger (Tr\u00f8llkonufingur) which was unspectacular due to clouds obstructing the sun but still fun. After breakfast, we headed out to find the lake above the sea. We did, but not before shelling out 200 Kr\u00f3na each for the privilege of access to the footways. A nicely spoken local girl was manning the barricade and promising tea and coffee when we returned from our hike. B\u00f8sdalafossur Fuji X-T2 XF16mm ISO 200 f/16 1/50s, some post processing in Capture One Pro 20 Of course, she wasn't there when we returned after sunset. We didn't care much, having had around 10km and 120m of elevation to stretch our muscles on. Leitisvatn / S\u00f8rv\u00e1gsvatn lake (\"the lake above the sea\") pours over the B\u00f8sdalafossur waterfall 30 metres into the sea below, which crashes dramatically against the cliff edges as if it were trying to get back up into the peaceful waters of the lake, where people were kayaking when we were there. Tr\u00e6lan\u00edpan (Slave Cliff) Tr\u00e6lan\u00edpan Ricoh GRIII ISO 200 f/5 1/400s, some post processing in Capture One Pro 20 The cliffs on the walk to the lake are several hundred metres above the sea and even on a fairly calm day, as today was, the thought of a sudden gust or a seagull with a sense of humour kept us focused and not too close to the edge. We met a local near the top of the walk who chatted in good English about the Scottish fishermen who threw chocolate to the local kids, who in turn sold lighters to the fishermen. My wife's grandfather was one of those fishermen. Yellow cottage near Mi\u00f0v\u00e1gur Yellow cottage near Mi\u00f0v\u00e1gur Fuji Pro 400H We passed this little shed-cum-cottage several times as we explored the area around Mi\u00f0v\u00e1gur. I had to stop to capture this scene with the Fuji Pro film I was carrying. I love the colours and would love to come back to see it again in the summer light. Nix: the Faroese Kelpie Nix X-T2 XF16mm ISO 400 f/2.8 1/500s pp and cropped in Capture One Pro 20 We found this artsy sculpture near the roadside that runs by Lake S\u00f8rv\u00e1gsvatn. It represents a Nykur, a mythical Scandinavian creature that drags children down to the bottom of the icy waters. Saying the name of the creature makes it lose all of its powers. I wonder if someone said the name of the sculptor. Fuji Acros 100 II First time out with Acros was in the early morning as the sun came up over the Tr\u00f8llkonufingur. In retrospect, this is probably not the best situation to use this legendary contrasty film. The results were not stunning, in my view, and certainly not as good as I expected, but that's operator error and not a problem with the film stock. Notice the first few exposures are all long, but get less long as the Northern winter light improved. Frame Image Aperture Shutter Comment 1. Tr\u00f8llkonufingur f/32 1s Portrait 2.

I'm not giving up on it, because I've seen good results elsewhere but I'm not sufficiently expert to get the most out of orthographic film yet. This point is emphasised by the fact that I left the lens cap on for frames 2 and 3. My notes suggest I had an ND filter on for these pictures. That possibly didn't help much either.

Sunrise Ricoh GRIII ISO 800 f/16 1/30s, pp in Capture One Pro 20 We packed and I loaded my last roll of film, a Kodak Portra 160. Replenishing the hire car's tank with about 20 litres of petrol cost about 200 Kr\u00f3na, the same as a single adult ticket to walk on the land nearby.

The difference between the above two images goes beyond what you see, which is as much down to what I did with the image after it was developed as it is the difference in the two cameras. The Fuji is a medium format camera and produces negatives which are 6cm by 9cm in size: six times larger than those produced in the 35mm Nikon FM. This only really makes a difference if you want to make very large prints from the negatives, when the limitations of the photographer are as significant as anything else.

A couple of days later, when my wife and I went to the beach for some relief from the emerging COVID-19 situation, I took the camera along. Exposure heuristics On the beach, having not really thought about it properly, I decided to finish the film off. The Isolette doesn't have a meter, and I'd forgotten my Gossen, so I figured I'd give the \"Sunny 16\" rule a try. This goes something like: \"if it's sunny, and you're shooting at f/16, then the shutter speed is the inverse of the film speed.\" I later discovered that this fim had a speed rating of 100 ASA, but at the time I guessed that it might be a 400, so went for a shutter speed of 1/200th of a second at f/22. This blunder might have been mitigated against by the well-known heuristic or rule-of-thumb for expired films stock, which suggests that you should treat the film as being slower by 1 stop for every decade it is out of date. So, I should have rated the original 100 ASA film at 25. If all of those estimates and rules were correct, I was effectively underexposing on the beach by about 4 stops. They weren't.

Earlsferry, Fife. Ilford Delta is a well-known black and white film from the famous UK manufacturer that has been around for almost 30 years. I put a roll of 400 through a Nikon FM. This post describes some of the images I made and what I did with them. The film was exposed over the first few weeks of 2020 and sent to AG Photographic in Birmingham for developing. Harlow Water We had to take a trip to Essex in January and had time to take a walk along the River Stort that runs through a generic-looking town on the outskirts of London. The river seems clean enough to sustain life, as there were people fishing along the banks. The first image here is a crop: bottom right you can see fading from what looks like a light leak in the camera. I think it's something to do with the back plate. I bought this camera from eBay to replace my original 1970s Nikon FM that has a condemned shutter, and the back doesn't shut cleanly with the satisfying click of my original. Harlow Water Not sure I'd be eating any of the fish they caught, as there were dog walkers kicking their poochy-poo directly from where it was dropped on the tow path into the river. I asked one of the fishermen if this is normal behaviour round here. He said everybody did it. I was disappointed with that level of cultural disrespect amongst the dog-walking people of this town towards their environment. Despite being in the middle of an industrial estate, this little stretch of river, with its abandoned house-boats, is pretty, and no doubt home to a lot of life. It's worth exploring - there's more information here . Harlow Water The next image has been adjusted for tone in Capture One for a more vintage look. This might offend some \"analogue\" purists but I'm just playing here. There aren't any rules, and Capture One is a nice tool for messing about with images that might otherwise be considered uninteresting. Harlow Mill The Fife Coast When I next picked up the camera, we were up the East Neuk . I continued the split toning exercise with the next two frames, toning the shadows blue and the highlights in the complementary yellow. Bass Rock Here, the Forth River basks in sunrays from an approaching storm. The toning enhances, I think the menacing clouds and waters. For monochrome images, it might seem weird to re-introduce colour but I think as an artistic technique, it enhances these shore photos. It didn't work for me with the Harlow Water images. Forth River Kinghorn Beach The last of these photographs was taken a few days later, down on the beach at Kinghorn. It is untoned but suffers with the same light leak problem I talked about above. This image was taken in portrait orientation and cropped slightly to make use of the false flare. I think it looks OK. Kinghorn Summary of the results Reviews of this film suggest that it is very sharp, although I am sure that this is true only when in better hands. I am not convinced that I get the best results by sending it to AG Photographic, although I don't doubt they are the best of the labs out there. Perhaps this is just a manifestation of the Dunning-Kruger effect and I'll change my mind once I learn more about it. When I took a roll of photographs back in the 1970's and 1980's, I would consider it a success if I got one or two good frames from a roll of 135. I think I have half a dozen here that I'm pleased with, despite the leaky light problem. A significant factor in this increased success rate must be the greater opportunity there is to work with the images post-processing. Even the scanning tool 1 allows me to straighten the horizon. Next steps I will try this film again and process it myself to see if I get better results, but also maybe I ought to stop buying old cameras online and expecting them to perform optimally without at least letting someone who knows what they are doing check them over for me. Notes Frame 24 Bass Rocks This film was in my Nikon FM between 10th January and 14th March 2020. It was processed by AG Photolab. I switched lens part way through this film to a new 28mm f/2.8 Nikon which is very much better than the E series lens I had been using.

I am not convinced that I get the best results by sending it to AG Photographic, although I don't doubt they are the best of the labs out there. Perhaps this is just a manifestation of the Dunning-Kruger effect and I'll change my mind once I learn more about it. When I took a roll of photographs back in the 1970's and 1980's, I would consider it a success if I got one or two good frames from a roll of 135. I think I have half a dozen here that I'm pleased with, despite the leaky light problem. A significant factor in this increased success rate must be the greater opportunity there is to work with the images post-processing.

Young tree shoots Kodak Professional Ektachrome E100 is a new, fine grained colour transparency film perfectly suited to bright spring sunshine and the countryside. In good light, I have always favoured Kodak transparency film for colour saturation, so this first time out for me with Kodak's new T-grain modern slide film was a good exercise. Soaking up the sunshine at Pattiesmuir The April sun was splitting the sky, so we went out around Pattiesmuir, a local walking route which winds through rural pathways and copses, offering glimpses of the iconic Forth bridges and over rolling farmland. Frame 3. Pattiesmuir My wife and I have been going out with cameras for a number of years, both of us using Fuji X-series digital cameras usually. Recently, though, I have left the digital behind, and carried only a film camera. The more careful selections I am making is, I think, good for my photography because it slows me down and makes me think more carefully about framing, intent and especially the light. As a result, I do not take as many frames as I would with a digital camera in my hands. I find it hard to finish a roll of 36 in one go, and today was no exception. Norton Common I next picked up the camera when, on another sunny day, we took ourselves on a bitter-sweet reflective walk on Norton Common. Earlier that day, we had said goodbye to my beloved Mum and it felt right to take ourselves to this special place in my old hometown. We found deer, and squirrels, sunbeams and forget-me-nots there, all of which seemed to be speaking to us in some way that was comforting. Frame 24. Forget-me-nots We had stayed in a little Air B&B in the pretty village of Great Wymondley, the smaller of the two Wymondleys, not far from the A1. The country kitchen of the old stable block featured a table where we had sat in the sunrays and listened to the voices of the host's children playing at the big house. There were poppies. Frame 30 Poppies Rosyth The remaining half dozen frames were made on short exercise trips out the back door and into the park during the continuing COVID-19 restrictions. Frame 35 Blossom Blossom is so photogenic, and we are lucky to be living in a place where there is plenty to be found at this time of year. The camera The camera I used for this roll was an eBay-sourced Nikon FM of similar vintage to my old FM, whose shutter was sadly condemned last year. It feels very similar but different, not least because the focusing screen is quite mucky, which reminds me every time I frame a shot that this is a substitute for my real Nikon FM. It's just not the same. I am loving the lens, however, which is the superb AI-s 28mm f/2.8 which gives excellent results across a range of apertures.

Recently, though, I have left the digital behind, and carried only a film camera. The more careful selections I am making is, I think, good for my photography because it slows me down and makes me think more carefully about framing, intent and especially the light. As a result, I do not take as many frames as I would with a digital camera in my hands.

Needless to say, I've had some results I am very pleased with, and a whole series of disappointments and frustrations with myself on the way. Focusing the Fuji My monster medium-format Fuji GW690ii (above, centre) is a rangefinder on steroids, one of a series of cameras known as the \"Texas Leicas\" on account of their size. They were made for Japanese bus tour customers, who got a souvenir snap of the group as they visited Mt. Fuji, or Kyoto, which was developed and printed in time for the end of the trip. The huge 6cm x 9cm negatives it produces are large enough to render detail from the fixed 90mm lens even when enlarged and printed for the office wall. I bought a \"near mint\" one from ODA-Japan at the end of 2019 for over \u00a3500 including taxes and fees. From the listing: Grade: Near Mint - Pre-owned, minimal signs of use. Appearance is very beautiful, tiny scuffs from normal use. It shows signs of use. *Please check photos. New Light Seals!! Optics: Beautiful condition. None of those words, I have learned, describe the camera. I had been disappointed with some of the photos taken with it. This, for example, taken on Kinghorn Beach, I hoped would be much clearer: Parasurfers, Kinghorn Beach Fuji GW690ii, Ilford Pan F Plus 50, f/11 at 1/60s Sometimes sharpness doesn't matter too much. This image, taken on a trip to the Faroes before the COVID lockdown, still looks pretty nice to me, not least because the Portra film I was using is just wonderful if you catch the light right: Huts near V\u00e1gar Airport Fuji GW690ii, Kodak Portra 160, f/11 at 1/60s Two Nikon FMs My old Nikon FM, which went everywhere I did as I travelled with the military and then work from 1977 to the turn of the century, had been condemned by Lehmans as being beyond repair, specifically, the shutter mechanism, for which no spares are available. Its \"FULLY TESTED EXCELLENT \" replacement I had bought from SE Cameras (eBay) has never been right, showing light leaks and odd exposure variations. Here's an example: Parasurfers at Kinghorn, Nikon FM , Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8, Ilford Delta 400, f/16 at 1/125s. Yellow filter. The light leaks were particularly bad in a recent film - 20 of the 36 exposures were spoiled - and this is what triggered me to finally take action and get professional help. The CLA Practice makes perfect, they say, and they also say that a bad workman blames his tools. That said, I bet even Chippendale launched more than one of his chisels across the workshop on his learning journey. Ergo, I decided recently to get these cameras \"CLA\"-ed, or clean, lubricate, and adjust -ed. I took the two Nikons and the Fuji to a little repair shop in Morningside, Edinburgh and asked, if possible, for them to make one good camera out of the two Nikons, and fix any focusing problems there might be in the Fuji. All I really wanted to know is whether the criticism I have had of recent photographs is all down to poor technique, or whether it might - just might - be something to do with the camera. I picked up the three cameras today, all in excellent working order, with a clear list of things that had been done to them and an assurance (and a reasonable limited warranty) that they are \"to specification\". Can't wait to get out with some film in them. Lessons learned Don't buy from eBay and expect things to be as described Get cameras that are new to you, checked and serviced Get your CLA done by a reputable, local repair shop Recommended suppliers I buy (too much) film from Analogue Wonderland , and get it developed at AG Photolab , who have been brilliant in helping me make sense of some of the recent exposure problems. Cameratiks in Edinburgh is staffed by calm, competent and polite people who know what they are doing. They are not cheap, nor are they expensive: you can buy quality digital and film gear there, and have them offer decent advice on the basis that you will go back there next time you need anything.

They were made for Japanese bus tour customers, who got a souvenir snap of the group as they visited Mt. Fuji, or Kyoto, which was developed and printed in time for the end of the trip. The huge 6cm x 9cm negatives it produces are large enough to render detail from the fixed 90mm lens even when enlarged and printed for the office wall. I bought a \"near mint\" one from ODA-Japan at the end of 2019 for over \u00a3500 including taxes and fees. From the listing: Grade: Near Mint - Pre-owned, minimal signs of use. Appearance is very beautiful, tiny scuffs from normal use. It shows signs of use. *Please check photos. New Light Seals!! Optics: Beautiful condition. None of those words, I have learned, describe the camera. I had been disappointed with some of the photos taken with it. This, for example, taken on Kinghorn Beach, I hoped would be much clearer: Parasurfers, Kinghorn Beach Fuji GW690ii, Ilford Pan F Plus 50, f/11 at 1/60s Sometimes sharpness doesn't matter too much. This image, taken on a trip to the Faroes before the COVID lockdown, still looks pretty nice to me, not least because the Portra film I was using is just wonderful if you catch the light right: Huts near V\u00e1gar Airport Fuji GW690ii, Kodak Portra 160, f/11 at 1/60s","title":"Focusing the Fuji"},{"location":"Stories/2020/2020-07-30-film-cameras/#two-nikon-fms","text":"My old Nikon FM, which went everywhere I did as I travelled with the military and then work from 1977 to the turn of the century, had been condemned by Lehmans as being beyond repair, specifically, the shutter mechanism, for which no spares are available.

Here's an example: Parasurfers at Kinghorn, Nikon FM , Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8, Ilford Delta 400, f/16 at 1/125s. Yellow filter.

I took the two Nikons and the Fuji to a little repair shop in Morningside, Edinburgh and asked, if possible, for them to make one good camera out of the two Nikons, and fix any focusing problems there might be in the Fuji. All I really wanted to know is whether the criticism I have had of recent photographs is all down to poor technique, or whether it might - just might - be something to do with the camera.

Amongst her possessions was a little point-and-shoot automatic 35mm camera, a Premier PC-645D. It still had a film in it. I took the camera with me on a couple of trips, including our anniversary weekend to Dunkeld, where we had been married the year before. In some sense, it was a way of making up for her not being able to travel up to Scotland for our wedding: we had taken her the albums of the wedding to see before she was admitted to hospital on Christmas Eve 2019. For a short while this year, it was as if she was with us. Her final pictures were typical. This one, evidence of a mystery. A bungee strap had suddenly appeared with a clatter on the roof of her cottage one day, on the day a stowaway's body was found in a Clapham garden. Mum was convinced that this strap had something to do with it and alerted the authorities, who took no interest. I told her that I thought it entirely feasible that the strap might be connected to the tragedy somehow. Bungee from the sky The second is of three visitors to her little house in Letchworth, Michelle, Marilyn and Tracey, cousins on the Brennan side (my grandmother's). Mum often had visitors; Michelle wrote of this visit: I lost her phone number and we just went unannounced, but she still made us welcome. I'm so grateful we decided to go anyway as this was to be the last time we saw her. Letchworth captured my heart, and from the first time I went with my mum to re-unite with the cousins Audreys, I absolutely adored your mum, such a beautiful and fascinating lady. I will never forget all her advice, she taught me so much that I didn't know about our family on the Brennan side, especially the ones that emigrated to Canada. Three visitors We took a trip along the coast near us, to Crail. Here's my wife at work, and the kind of place mum would have enjoyed being if she were able to travel. Her health wasn't the best, it never had been, but she never offered it as an excuse or let it prevent her from living the most fruitful and interesting life. The crashing waves on this rocky coast would have been right up her street. Crail Finally, on the weekend to Dunkeld, I took a selfie for mum of my wife and I in the mirror in our suite, not taking into account the flash on this little point-and-shoot, \"focus free\" camera.

Bungee from the sky The second is of three visitors to her little house in Letchworth, Michelle, Marilyn and Tracey, cousins on the Brennan side (my grandmother's). Mum often had visitors; Michelle wrote of this visit: I lost her phone number and we just went unannounced, but she still made us welcome. I'm so grateful we decided to go anyway as this was to be the last time we saw her. Letchworth captured my heart, and from the first time I went with my mum to re-unite with the cousins Audreys, I absolutely adored your mum, such a beautiful and fascinating lady. I will never forget all her advice, she taught me so much that I didn't know about our family on the Brennan side, especially the ones that emigrated to Canada. Three visitors We took a trip along the coast near us, to Crail. Here's my wife at work, and the kind of place mum would have enjoyed being if she were able to travel. Her health wasn't the best, it never had been, but she never offered it as an excuse or let it prevent her from living the most fruitful and interesting life. The crashing waves on this rocky coast would have been right up her street. Crail Finally, on the weekend to Dunkeld, I took a selfie for mum of my wife and I in the mirror in our suite, not taking into account the flash on this little point-and-shoot, \"focus free\" camera. I can't help thinking that the flare somehow indicates her presence with us on that day as we celebrated our anniversary, and remembered a remarkable woman.

After Christmas. Some thoughts at the end of an interesting year. Glenquey reservoir Like many people, I don't see the point of making resolutions at the end of the year, only to break them within a few days of returning to normal life, its pressures and temptations. This year, the (first?) year of pandemic restrictions, has given us all opportunities to reflect a little: the reflection necessarily includes looking at oneself. Here is where we see ourselves more objectively -- in the moments of noticing just how we change as we get older. Perhaps also, we observe how we have not changed when we ought to have. The old year Glendevon Well, there's been COVID, of course, but there have been other things going on. We lost my Mum in March, after a 3-month circus tour of various hospitals and the lottery of the NHS that began on Christmas Eve 2019. Others left us too, and there is sadness more than usual this Christmas as we remember them. Without diminishing our losses, there has also been much joy: weddings, our own first anniversary which was spent in favourite places around Dunkeld; and the last instalments of our honeymoon with friends in the North, and then even further North in the Faroes. The new year This image of a bridge at Glendevon 1 suggests that as we cross into the New Year, the road may be slippery at times. We probably need to lose a bit of weight (I feel like I am 7ft 6in wide in places), and we certainly ought to slow down a bit. Working life, not to be ungrateful for my exciting and challenging job 2 , has been more challenge than excitement in 2020. I have COVID back from Zooming too much from the couch, suffered nightmares from stress anxiety and have more than once drafted a desperate resignation letter. The Christmas break has reminded me of the blessings proper sleep brings. I resolve to sleep better. Beyond the bridge, we are advised that we must not park in passing places, so as to not be a nuisance to others and obstruct their passage. This year, I have noticed even more that I have not been quite who I was before becoming an educator: ever since that career move in 2003, I have had an insidious, creeping feeling that I don't belong, that I am somehow in the way. I resolve to assert with confidence and authority, as I spent so long learning, my confidence and authority. May I not overdo that resolution. Or, may I do it so well I have to return to a more lucrative profession. Or, maybe something else entirely. Not photography, perhaps, there's no money in that 3 . Photography The last sign to heed in our bridge image is \"Danger of death\" . Susan Sontag said, \"All photographs are memento mori\" and she is right, even outwith the context she said that in.

Film photography, it is often said, requires a slower, more thoughtful approach than the spray-and-pray approach of digital.

The first roll of photographs in 2021 was also a first time for me shooting Kodak Tri-X 400 film, and also the first roll through the Hasselblad 503CW I bought over Christmas. We couldn't go to the Moon to shoot with this iconic camera, so we slogged it to the top of a local hill on a very chilly winter morning. It was a crampon day, according to a chap we passed on the walk to Glenquey reservoir where our ascent started. He seemed confident enough on the icy path back down so we took it to be banter. As it turned out, we might have benefited from crampons as we took what turned out to be a harder route up the hill. We had poles, and wouldn't have completed the climb without them for sure. I \"stand\" processed the film in Rodinal 1:100 for 60 minutes. The film was quite curly when it dried, so I cut it into strips and put it in a book 2 for half an hour before scanning. Very quickly, as I scanned, a more serious issue presented itself. The first image from Innerdownie Hill. Here, we see a light leak, which comes from the left hand side of the film magazine as seen when shooting. This is disappointing, but I am assured by the very helpful and supportive community of Hasselblad film photographers that this is to be expected when buying an old camera. A proper inspection is required by people experienced in such things, and fortunately, I know of such people not far from where I live that can do that. There is some question about whether I introduced problems during development, but I don't think so, having used this method before without problem. If it had been a development issue, then the banding might have gone the other way (and appeared at the bottom of the frame).

Lessons learned About the film On reading the Kodak data sheet for the film stock, I might have over-exposed for the conditions on the hill, which problem may have been masked by stand processing. Most of the snowscape shots were taken at f/11, 1/125s, which is over the suggested f/22, 1/500s for Bright/Hazy Sun on Light Sand or Snow . I used my Nikon FM as a meter on the hill but quite possibly this is an unreliable witness: it had a number 8 yellow filter for which I had compensated 1/3 stop but the TriX data sheet suggests 2 stops for this filter. Next time, I'll use my digital camera for metering. About old cameras It is to be expected that older equipment needs to be maintained and looked after. If buying second hand, assume that inspection and sevice by an experienced technician is needed before you will get the best out of the investment, and budget for it. About stand developing Film manufacturers produce data sheets that are worth following until you have enough experience to vary. There are situations where stand development is a good idea: perhaps where individual frames have been pushed.

The first roll of photographs in 2021 was also a first time for me shooting Kodak Tri-X 400 film, and also the first roll through the Hasselblad 503CW I bought over Christmas. We couldn't go to the Moon to shoot with this iconic camera, so we slogged it to the top of a local hill on a very chilly winter morning. It was a crampon day, according to a chap we passed on the walk to Glenquey reservoir where our ascent started. He seemed confident enough on the icy path back down so we took it to be banter. As it turned out, we might have benefited from crampons as we took what turned out to be a harder route up the hill. We had poles, and wouldn't have completed the climb without them for sure. I \"stand\" processed the film in Rodinal 1:100 for 60 minutes. The film was quite curly when it dried, so I cut it into strips and put it in a book 2 for half an hour before scanning. Very quickly, as I scanned, a more serious issue presented itself. The first image from Innerdownie Hill. Here, we see a light leak, which comes from the left hand side of the film magazine as seen when shooting. This is disappointing, but I am assured by the very helpful and supportive community of Hasselblad film photographers that this is to be expected when buying an old camera. A proper inspection is required by people experienced in such things, and fortunately, I know of such people not far from where I live that can do that. There is some question about whether I introduced problems during development, but I don't think so, having used this method before without problem.

Again, using my new Digitaliza film holders and a new MacBook Air, the scans were interesting. In this series: Brand Type ISO Format Exposures Camera Lens Kodak Ektachrome E100 100 120 8 Fuji GW690ii 90mm Cinestill 800 T 800 35mm 36 Nikon FM Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8 Lomography Metropolis EI 400 120 12 Hasselblad 503CW Zeiss 80mm F2.8 C Ilford Delta 3200 35mm 36 Nikon FM Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 160 35mm 36 Nikon FM Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8 Ektachrome I am becoming a big fan of Kodak's modern slide film: no big surprise, really, because years ago I favoured Kodachrome and Agfa's transparency film in my Nikon FM. Here, a few frames in the huge Fuji GW690ii 6 x 9 camera taken around Kilconquhar and St Monans around 9th April. Scanned at 3200 dpi, the digital images are about 80 mega pixels in size, although sharpness doesn't satisfy the pixel-neurotic: it's colours that make these images worth making. Church at Kilconquhar. Fuji GW690ii, Ektachrome E100 The composition here isn't perfect: it was tempting to crop out the part-of-a-treee on the left of this picture but there is something in me that wants to crop and adjust as little as possible. I can see what I was thinking with the line of the path central to the composition and am pleased that I kept these parallel to the lines of the church tower. There's always a bit of difference between what you see in the rangefinder window and the image on the film so I consider this a successful image. Kilconquhar. Fuji GW690ii, Ektachrome E100 I like the colours in this image taken at the loch, facing in the other direction, a few paces from where I captured the church. The complementary sky and grass tones here work for me. What is most impressive with this film stock is that there is almost no post processing required -- the header sunset image taken in February at Pattiesmuir shows this, I think, as well as these snaps from Kilconquhar and St. Monans. Sunlight and good skies are a real bonus too. St. Monan's harbour. Fuji GW690ii, Ektachrome E100 Taken from the walk down to the famous wonky sea wall at St. Monans, this again might have been cropped on the left if it had been a digital capture. I love the two-weather sky here. Cinestill 800T Flowers at Dumbarnie Links, Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T Cinestill 800T is a fast popular film stock, with the \"T\" indicating that it is designed to be used in tungsten light. It's ideal for shooting urban scenes at night, which was my intention when I bought a few rolls of 135 and 120 at the beginning of 2021. This first roll was exposed in April in a Nikon FM in daylight at Seafield Beach, Dumbarnie Links (frames 16--25) and Elie (frames 26ff). Scanning as before, I processed them in Capture One, severely adjusting white balance and contrast to compensate for the blue shift of the abused film. Seafield Beach. Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T This seemed to do the trick, rendering colours realistically with only two slider adjustments off the scanner. I'm learning to not allow the scanner to do anything with the colour of the files it creates. The above image of flowers at Dumbarnie Links illustrates this. I'm generally pleased with the results if not a little meh about my collection of dead boring images. Cinestill 800T is an exciting film to use for exciting images: punchy urban scenes evocative of some other era or dark filmic concepts. It's not really meant for landscapes taken on walks, the purpose of which was not photography but clearing heads. I hope my next set of images with this film stock will do it better justice. Elie Beach. Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T I do like the rendering of contrast and tone in this film, once adjusted. Below, Lady's Tower on a sunny day in Fife gives the film a chance to show this to create a nice image that evokes the feeling of the moment it was captured. More than that, I guess, can't be asked for. Lady's Tower, Elie. Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T Lomography Metropolis St. Monans, Fife. Hasselblad 503CW, 80mm Zeiss. This film stock was introduced in 2019 as a new film emulsion with extended range, meaning that the sensitivity is stated on the box as ISO 100 -- 400 and you take your pick. I exposed this roll at the higher speed to see how it worked there. As with all of the films in this mini-series, I got AG Photographic to develop them for me. Bass Rock from Crail. Hasselblad 503CW, 80mm Zeiss. I first scanned this roll using 48-bit colour and 6400 dpi settings which produced square image files post-processing of about 180 megapixels. The colours are muted and cool. It took some time to find the correct white balance adjustment in Capture One but I think the image of St Monans church in Fife is a fair rendition of the film's character. I like that the contrast is strong. You will not see the Hasselblad notches in that image because, as with many of my hand-held photographs, the horizon was a bit squint, as they say around here, so I had to adjust it and crop. Crail, Fife. Hasselblad 503CW, 80mm Zeiss. This was the last useful frame off the roll, as some time later, during a visit to the Hermitage at Dunkeld, I reached for the Hasselblad and forgot there was film in it.

Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS As this is a black and white film, I might have developed this myself but as with all of the films in this mini-series, I got AG Photographic to develop it for me. It was scanned at 6400, then 3200 dpi in 24-bit colour (otherwise the scanner screws up the colour profile in the output file). In post-processing, the profile is switched to black and white. The early images were not of good enough resolution to justify 6400 dpi, hence the switch to something lower. Edinburgh, from Fife. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS Most of those early frames were quite disappointing, being underexposed and losing detail in the shadows. I'm fairly sure this was a metering issue: I rely on the built-in LED through-the-lens metering when shooting with the Nikon FM and this might be the price of laziness. Some can be recovered, though, and this image shows a sort of moody shoreline to illustrate the point. Edinburgh. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS This is the view from my office window on the Holyrood campus. Delta 3200 might suggest a good low-light film but I think it's more fast than it is good in the dark. It needs light to function properly. The next image also, perhaps, is more suited to the grainy emulsion of Delta 3200. The Palace, Rosyth. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS Something more urban in flavour demands not only monochrome but also the character of a grainy film stock like this. I don't think it handles wide dynamic range the way I had hoped, however. Shooting into the light is probably not the best idea: Harbour Bell, St.Monans. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS Delta 3200 can perform well with good light, and yield decent contrasty images if you meter and expose correctly. Kodak Portra 160 Queensferry Crossing from St. Margaret's Marsh I scanned most of these at 3200 or 4800 dpi in 48-bit colour with the scanner's colour handling switch off. The first few frames were taken at the Hermitage, near Dunkeld, during a weekend run up to one of our favourite places in May. We needed reflection time and the COVID restrictions were just so that we could do the right thing as we did The Right Thing for us. Ossian's Hall. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS The Dunkeld weekend was not in the brightest of sunshine and that tends to wash out the colours in Portra, I think. This is a dark and moody kind of place when it's overcast, so the image above does portray that. No marks for composition -- there's a better portrait version but that favours the bridge over the hall and I wanted to show that in this post. Queensferry Crossing from St. Margaret's Marsh There was better light when we walked on the Forth Shore at St. Margaret's Marsh, between the bridges and the dockyard. Some while later, we were at Loch Lubnaig where the colours of the greenery dominate the images taken with this film. I'm not such a fan of 160 in anything other than really good daylight. Composition plays a part, too, and these images aren't my best: the last few frames of the roll were taken at Burntisland.","title":"Five films"},{"location":"Stories/2021/2021-07-30-five-films/#five-films","text":"More random rolls from the COVID era February sunset at Patteismuir Continuing the series of films I had lost track of this year, there were another five exposed films kicking about with only partial notes and recall to record them.

Church at Kilconquhar. Fuji GW690ii, Ektachrome E100 The composition here isn't perfect: it was tempting to crop out the part-of-a-treee on the left of this picture but there is something in me that wants to crop and adjust as little as possible. I can see what I was thinking with the line of the path central to the composition and am pleased that I kept these parallel to the lines of the church tower. There's always a bit of difference between what you see in the rangefinder window and the image on the film so I consider this a successful image. Kilconquhar. Fuji GW690ii, Ektachrome E100 I like the colours in this image taken at the loch, facing in the other direction, a few paces from where I captured the church. The complementary sky and grass tones here work for me. What is most impressive with this film stock is that there is almost no post processing required -- the header sunset image taken in February at Pattiesmuir shows this, I think, as well as these snaps from Kilconquhar and St. Monans. Sunlight and good skies are a real bonus too. St. Monan's harbour.

It's ideal for shooting urban scenes at night, which was my intention when I bought a few rolls of 135 and 120 at the beginning of 2021. This first roll was exposed in April in a Nikon FM in daylight at Seafield Beach, Dumbarnie Links (frames 16--25) and Elie (frames 26ff). Scanning as before, I processed them in Capture One, severely adjusting white balance and contrast to compensate for the blue shift of the abused film. Seafield Beach. Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T This seemed to do the trick, rendering colours realistically with only two slider adjustments off the scanner. I'm learning to not allow the scanner to do anything with the colour of the files it creates. The above image of flowers at Dumbarnie Links illustrates this. I'm generally pleased with the results if not a little meh about my collection of dead boring images. Cinestill 800T is an exciting film to use for exciting images: punchy urban scenes evocative of some other era or dark filmic concepts. It's not really meant for landscapes taken on walks, the purpose of which was not photography but clearing heads. I hope my next set of images with this film stock will do it better justice. Elie Beach. Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T I do like the rendering of contrast and tone in this film, once adjusted. Below, Lady's Tower on a sunny day in Fife gives the film a chance to show this to create a nice image that evokes the feeling of the moment it was captured.

The colours are muted and cool. It took some time to find the correct white balance adjustment in Capture One but I think the image of St Monans church in Fife is a fair rendition of the film's character. I like that the contrast is strong. You will not see the Hasselblad notches in that image because, as with many of my hand-held photographs, the horizon was a bit squint, as they say around here, so I had to adjust it and crop.

We will be mellow, perhaps, as we savour the memories of the recent weekend.","title":"Ard Daraich Anniversary trip"},{"location":"Stories/2021/2021-10-18-ard-daraich/#hasselblad-images","text":"I feel I have to show you some comparatives, starting with this image.

Beach salad, Hasselblad 503CW This image is quite different from the russet reds of the digital capture I made at the same time: here, no adjustments were made after scanning other than a slight crop adjustment. I think it's just as strong in rendering the emotion of the moment. You can almost smell it. This is my favourite image from the roll and one I might print. The Frandy Tree, Glendevon, Hasselblad 503CW This is a famous tree to those who walk near Glendevon, as we did shortly after we got home. We know it as the Frandy Tree, named for the nearby fishery. It stands alone at the foot of Common Hill and strikes one of those poses that looks different at different times and seasons but also from different directions.

A trip to the Hebrides for a short summer break demanded at least some effort, so I took my Fuji X-T2 and three lenses; the Ricoh GR-III ; and one concession to analogue photography, the Agfa Isolette . Skye We drove cross-country from the Forth to Skye Bridges, taking our time to shop a little at the House of Bruar (one has to , surely) and dally at Sligachan bridge, an old favourite of ours with a newish statue to the mountaineers Prof. Norman Collie and John Mackenzie.

Overnighting at a Hostel in Portree, we took the early ferry from Uig to Loch Maddy. I am always impressed with CalMac's well-oiled operation, especially compared to the sometimes stressful experience of air travel. The 90 minute crossing was smooth and only slightly disappointing for not spotting seals at Vaternish Point. We consoled ourselves with a bacon and egg banjo in the \"Mariners\" caf\u00e9. Five Islands The first couple of days in our remote \"pod\" were quite overcast with an ever-present wind between 20 and 40 mph, as the rest of the UK was baking in a record-breaking heat wave.

The colours of the water and the machair were striking, different at every location and under the changing light. The sands are also rich with pattern and shade (below). The header image on this page was taken at Traigh Lar on North Uist which became one of our favourite places on our short trip.

Back on East Beach, the sands are also rich with pattern and texture. The countryside is rich with signs that it is expensive to dispose of old machinery and vehicles. Some effort seems to be made to at least gather the wreckage together. At Baleshare, a small collection of refrigerated trailers was forming. This one has signs of another era, like you see when shops change hands and ancient signwriting appears for a while. Dead trailer Ricoh GR III, processed in Capture One. These two at least look like they're trying to keep out of sight. The wheels stick out like shoes from under a curtain. Hidden trailers Ricoh GR III, a similar process in Capture One. To Eriskay and back We drove the length of the Outer Hebrides, at least without leaving the land. There are many causeways now connecting the various island communities and making commerce and life in general much easier for the people who live and work here. We visited five islands: North and South Uist, Berneray, Benbecula and Eriskay. We're not counting Baleshare, although it connects to North Uist by another causeway. Most of the time one side of the causeway is all sand, and when it's not, you could probably still wade across. We didn't test that theory. Howmore Bothy (Fuji, Nikon 85mm lens) Everywhere there are what seems like abandoned or derelict buildings. This example I photographed with both the Fuji (above) and the Ricoh (below) to create a different mood. I'm not sure how successful it is: the wider angle of the Ricoh allows more context to create a story with. Howmore Bothy (Ricoh, 18mm lens) What really captured my heart during our leisurely and unstructured schlep around these islands was the sheer loveliness of the flowers that are just everywhere, clearly loved and protected by the local people. The wildflower meadowland that edges the beaches and reaches inland is diverse and colourful. I took far too many photographs of these flowers but will not tire of them as they adorn my desktop and walls in the coming months. Here, from the beach at Eriskay, right by the Barra Ferry terminal, is Sea Rocket: Fuday Island from Prince Charles' Beach, Eriskay Sea Rocket, Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm lens. Back \"home\" to the bothy and a walk after dinner on our own beach on the doorstep, entertained on the way by rabbits and various birds playing and raising families in the meadowland. The beach at Baleshare , Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm lens. Along the way, we met many of the residents. Residents Locals Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm The islands have a thriving farming sector and there are sheep on every single-track road personally introducing themselves to foreign visitors. Birds are many and diverse: it is easy to see a host of sea birds in and around the machar and on the hillsides are Golden Eagles, Hen Harriers and short-eared owls hunting in the daytime. Locals Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm The diversity of the wildlife is noticeable for visitors like us from the central belt of Scotland. We seem to have a disproportionate seagull population and we can probably do with less of the fat pigeons and magpies, frankly. Where once working families lived, now stand more mechanised, efficient farming practices that make use of the land by fewer humans. A still nascent tourism industry is booked to capacity and locals still wave as visitors yield the right of way in the passing places. There is potential for development of abandoned plots and buildings across the islands. I hope that never comes to spoil the place. The roadside food wagon is no innovation nor is it a quaint enterprise: the food is home-made, delicious and locally sourced. You have to try the scallops and black pudding roll. Radio buzzers notify in your car when your lunch is ready and yes, they take contactless American Express. Check out the recycling bins. Even the coffee-cup lids are made of paper pulp. The Outer Hebrideans are right on trend when it comes to sustainable service. Sea birds abound along the shorelines and there are sites of special scientific interest intended to protect the diverse species, not least those that depend on the environment to breed and thrive. There are as many halfwits who will open gates to drive their SUVs across these spaces to access their picnics, of course but we think we saw at least one person openly challenge such behaviour. Most precious and beautiful of the environmental backdrop here is the machair. It is looked after and protected, as far as one can protect from human activity. Here may be common buttercups and clover but if you look, you can see many kinds of orchid. Au Revoir This image will give you a sense of what we had hoped for when we headed North on our holiday. That image is actually a stitch of 8 images taken with the X-T2 and 35mm f/2 lens. Each image was exposed at f/8, 1/125s at ISO 200 and assembled into a panorama in Capture One. It should make a nice print about 50 inches x 20 inches if I ever get around to that. Our sixth island of the trip was Skye, of course, our gateway to the Outer Hebrides. The hills and skies of Skye are something to behold: a mere photograph, least of all a digital image on a computer screen, can't give you anything like the sense of being there . I tried with images like this pano, taken from the side of the road on the way from Carbost, not far from Sligachan where this series of posts began. The Broadford Co-Op was full of surprises.

Oh, and this view from the car park: What we got from our trip was much better than we had hoped for, of course. We had the chance to explore and learn, visit and revisit under changing skies and light. We left with just the tip of a toe dipped in Hebridean life. In the end, I only took one photo with the Agfa.

We have not often chosen the Borders over our more usual favourite direction of North but wanted, as usual, a decent distance from hustle and bustle, nature and a wood-burning stove to curl up in front of at the end of the day. A place to read, reflect, walk and enjoy life together. Not far from Hawick, the Summer House offers all of that and more. The Summer House from the lake This place has been fairly recently renovated and is cosy, warm and spacious enough for families and small groups to enjoy the stunning countryside here. There is a lake close by with swans and moorhens. A young deer met us on the driveway as we headed on to the estate. Owls serenaded the night. An otter played chicken with us in the road and then blew otter raspberries from the safety of a hedge. Chisholme House Chisholme House We did not go for (or know about) the retreats offered by the school at Chisholme but were intrigued and perhaps focused a little by the environment. From their website : Dedicated to the art of self discovery Chisholme offers an education for those who are convinced of our potential as human beings for goodness and positive effect on this earth, and who wish to be of service to it, to love and to learn. A sense of Sufism There seems to be no particular religion behind the philosophy at Chisholme but the school considers writings of great scholars of Islam, in particular those in the Sufi tradition such as Rumi and Ibn'Arabi. The Summer House includes artefacts of the three Abrahamic faiths of Islam, Christianity and Judaism. The Basmala appears at threshholds to the old and new summerhouse. The older summer house is in the walled garden, which is well tended by the gardner and a team of volunteers who give service as a form of study and reflection. Quotes from Bulent Rauf and others suggest that central to the teachings of the Institute is unity of life and self discovery. On the hill above the house is the Monument to Man: The Monument to Man above the estate has engraved around the circumference, \"ALL ARE FROM HIM AND TO HIM THEY RETURN\", resonant with similar phrases in the Bible (e.g. Romans 11:36) and the Qu'ran (e.g. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:156). In the ground near to the monument, with its four pillars representing Chisholme's own pillars of work , study , meditation and zikr , is a circular stone bearing the inscription: O CONFIDENT SOUL, RETURN TO YOUR LORD, AGREEING AND AGREED TO ENTER AMONG MY SERVANTS AND ENTER MY PARADISE This is a variation of another well known passage from the Qu'ran, Surah 89, Al-Fajr (Dawn, verses 26 -- 30). Time Travel to Tushielaw We didn't stay in the house for the whole weekend, and ventured out on a trip to Tushielaw for Sunday lunch. Despite high expectations for nice country pub food, instead it became more of a journey in time back to the 1970s. You had to have been there, of course, to fully appreciate the standard of service and fag reek over the sausage, egg 'n' chips with a choice of two sauces. And the footie on the telly. And the time it took for mine host to work out by hand, calculator, pen and paper in hand, the bill. And the landlady's omnidirectional blather at anyone, or no-one, in the lounge. Such experience serves to remind us of how fortunate we are to be who we are. Reflection Cygnet on the lake It takes little reflection on life to see this ugly duckling as the gracious beauty he is becoming. Our weekend at the summer house gave us time and space to discuss things that concern us and things that make us. We took time and space to see ourselves more clearly and shared life and laughter. We resolved to act, and to not act, on these things. Chisholme draws on Lao Tsu for some of its teaching, describing it: The philosophy of Lao Tsu is simple: Accept what is in front of you without wanting the situation to be other than it is. Study the natural order of things and work with it rather than against it, for to try to change what is only sets up resistance. I think this understates Lao Tsu's recognition of man's free will and ability to use it. On the way home, we took advice from the Hadith: Anas ibn Malik reported: A man said, \u201cO Messenger of Allah, should I tie my camel and trust in Allah, or should I leave her untied and trust in Allah?\u201d The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, \u201cTie her and trust in Allah.\u201d Source: Sunan al-Tirmidhi\u0304 2517 Notes on camera equipment All of the pictures on this page were made with a Fuji X-T2 camera, and either the Fujifilm Fujinon XF16mmF1.4 R WR wide-angle lens, the 100-400 or my old Nikon 85mm Ai-S f/1.4.

The schedule can be challenging so I always try to arrive around 20 minutes early so as to check any messages, and enter the school with grace and dignity. On this cycle of visits, I thought I'd use the extra time to also practice some sketching. Linlithgow Academy There is a rationale for this habit. Sketching is a deliberate, mindful process, even when done quickly. It helps you see what is there, and the looking doesn't stop when the sketchbook is closed. At Linlithgow, I found myself studying wall displays, people, the dynamic of school reception spaces, looking at shapes and patterns as much as inscriptions. I even got the chance to assist some not-yet-detective material police officers in their hunt for the reception desk, being able to indicate the huge sign that my fine-tuned sketcher's observational skills had spotted in the lobby. Deans Community High School We continue to invest in building new schools to replace older, more out of date infrastructure. This is a good thing for many reasons including sending a message to the country that education is important and valuable to us all. Whilst every school is different, certain design features and material choices appear in many of the recent builds, perhaps dating them. This is not to say they look the same -- they do, in some respects, but each has its own features according to the perceived needs of the community they serve. Kirkcaldy High School I taught Physics and Mathematics at Kirkcaldy High School for a number of years before replacing my own tutor at Moray House. I'm not going to reminisce about this old place but it was nice to go back for a visit and see friends and former colleagues again. I was reminded that cultures are slow to change and that whilst rolling stones may gather no moss, they do gather experience you don't get standing still. Bunsen burners, magnesium strips and good dialogic pedagogy made my job easy at Preston Lodge today. All the nicer to see more old friends, too. Education is a village, and once you've been at it a while, it can feel like going home when you meet again, people who have shared different parts of your journey. Conversations pick up where they left off, friendship hugs shock the pupils, and mutual respect is grown and shared from stories of careers unfolding. I love it when new teachers see that: they are enculturated into their vocation through the modelled behaviours of those that go before them, and shape them. There's more to this than Vygotksy, or Bruner, or the latest educational fad. Preston Lodge High School Portobello High School Preston Lodge and Portobello sketches are not the best likeness to the real thing , for similar reasons. At Preston Lodge, my view from the car was obscured by a large van and so I had to interpret and sketch what I felt was there. Isn't that the point, though? The American photographer David Alan Harvey said, \"Don't shoot what it looks like. Shoot what it feels like.\" This is my motivation in photography as much as in sketching, and exploring that idea is the principal reason for me wanting to sketch more often. At Portobello, a different large van also obscured the view, and I don't have the confidence quite to stand in a car park sketching, in full view of the CCTV. I had a call to go in to school anyway, so I took a quick photo on my phone and sketched it up later in a caf\u00e9 over lunch. From this experience, I think I do a better job sketching live, en plein air , than from a photo. Something seems to be missing in my drawing from a photo, at least where my skills are at present. Perhaps that will change with practice. The lorry at Leith, with a fast rat Leith Academy has a nice front fa\u00e7ade but you can't see it from where I parked, and the back of the building is ugly, so I sketched the random lorry in the car park instead. I did not find out what the vehicle does, or why it's there, but it looks arty to me, even if it seems past its best service days. Leith has always felt like an arty school: it has interesting shaped science labs which are full of scope and character, even if some of the electrical infrastructure also seems past its best service days. The teachers are anything but, of course, nor the businesslike head teacher who introduced himself as I was preparing to leave for my next appointment. It's great that there are schools like Leith who put the effort and investment into new teachers, for the wider good of Scottish education. Musselburgh Grammar School There is a quid pro quo , of course, in the benefit that mentors and other colleagues get from watching rookies make na\u00efve mistakes and offering guidance and advice from experience, at the same time tapping in to new ideas and reconnecting to the principles of pedagogy that are fresh in the student teachers' thinking. This was articulated in both schools I visited today by the supporting teachers who played their important part in bringing about fair and just evaluation of how their charges have progressed. Queensferry CHS, in the fog There was a thick fog for my journey across the Forth to Queensferry and I almost bottled doing the sketch because I don't know how to draw fog. I had a word with myself and thought, \"just put the pen marks where it's dark, and don't put them where it's light\". Easier said than, done, I think, so I diverted myself by trying to capture a couple of figures approaching the pool of light from the lamp. I remember a sketcher artist I follow said that figures add interest to a sketch. I think they are right, but I prefer the Leith rat, if I'm honest. Deans CHS again Back to Deans again and a view from a different part of the car park. It's interesting how varied these buildings can look, depending on where you look from. My wife calls my style \"Roobarb\", for the unsteady hand that wiggles the lines. I did get an 'O' level many years ago in technical drawing, so I do know how to use a ruler but when I'm trying to work quickly -- none of these sketches took more than about 10 minutes -- the look is more one of impression than technical accuracy. I was conscious that I was cold sitting in the car at Deans and so the lines were more Roobarb than usual, perhaps. More figure suggestions, though, and they seem to be growing on me. I'm quite pleased with the silver birch, too, given that I'm not giving myself time to make 10,000 strokes for the leaves. Dingwall A long but pleasant drive up beyond Inverness took me to new territory, and once more found me shaking hands with colleagues who had passed through my tutorials at Moray House. It's lovely to see the products of my labour thriving and making their mark on young people across the country. I am taking all the credit, of course, as I will for the superb teacher whose lesson on nuclear fission was one of the best I have ever seen. It's not all me, of course: a lot of work goes in to becoming a teacher, especially a good one, and you have to bring a lot of things, too. Attitude, aptitude, wit, intelligence, humour, resilience, just to mention a few. Those who bring all of that with them perhaps don't need much from me to succeed, but I do like to tell myself that I help them excel. Broxburn Academy As the weeks of touring schools come to an end for this session at least, I feel that I have been inspired by students, colleagues and the young people in schools. The student teachers have a steep learning curve, especially on their first school placement. Workload can be an issue, and both schools and the university urge the students to try to find a good, healthy, sustainable balance. I asked some of them what their \"secret\" is for managing this. All said that the balance is crucial to survival, and that part of that is remaining physically active through sport or exercise. Some of them run; others swim or play a sport. This advice I took myself today by going for a run in the early morning darkness. Vehicles are often a challenge for schools at the beginning and end of the day, even more so when parking is limited, so the final visit of the tour found me arriving at my destination later than planned. I parked in a quiet residential area and enjoyed a walk through the catchment instead of having time to sketch. By now, I was thinking that although every school is different, I had probably sketched enough fairly-recently-built school buildings to have a good appreciation for their character.","title":"School Sketches"},{"location":"Stories/2022/2022-12-05-school-sketches/#school-sketches","text":"During late November and early December, my job has required me to make visits to schools.

Kirkcaldy High School I taught Physics and Mathematics at Kirkcaldy High School for a number of years before replacing my own tutor at Moray House. I'm not going to reminisce about this old place but it was nice to go back for a visit and see friends and former colleagues again. I was reminded that cultures are slow to change and that whilst rolling stones may gather no moss, they do gather experience you don't get standing still. Bunsen burners, magnesium strips and good dialogic pedagogy made my job easy at Preston Lodge today. All the nicer to see more old friends, too. Education is a village, and once you've been at it a while, it can feel like going home when you meet again, people who have shared different parts of your journey. Conversations pick up where they left off, friendship hugs shock the pupils, and mutual respect is grown and shared from stories of careers unfolding. I love it when new teachers see that: they are enculturated into their vocation through the modelled behaviours of those that go before them, and shape them. There's more to this than Vygotksy, or Bruner, or the latest educational fad. Preston Lodge High School Portobello High School Preston Lodge and Portobello sketches are not the best likeness to the real thing , for similar reasons. At Preston Lodge, my view from the car was obscured by a large van and so I had to interpret and sketch what I felt was there. Isn't that the point, though? The American photographer David Alan Harvey said, \"Don't shoot what it looks like. Shoot what it feels like.\" This is my motivation in photography as much as in sketching, and exploring that idea is the principal reason for me wanting to sketch more often. At Portobello, a different large van also obscured the view, and I don't have the confidence quite to stand in a car park sketching, in full view of the CCTV. I had a call to go in to school anyway, so I took a quick photo on my phone and sketched it up later in a caf\u00e9 over lunch. From this experience, I think I do a better job sketching live, en plein air , than from a photo. Something seems to be missing in my drawing from a photo, at least where my skills are at present. Perhaps that will change with practice. The lorry at Leith, with a fast rat Leith Academy has a nice front fa\u00e7ade but you can't see it from where I parked, and the back of the building is ugly, so I sketched the random lorry in the car park instead. I did not find out what the vehicle does, or why it's there, but it looks arty to me, even if it seems past its best service days. Leith has always felt like an arty school: it has interesting shaped science labs which are full of scope and character, even if some of the electrical infrastructure also seems past its best service days. The teachers are anything but, of course, nor the businesslike head teacher who introduced himself as I was preparing to leave for my next appointment. It's great that there are schools like Leith who put the effort and investment into new teachers, for the wider good of Scottish education. Musselburgh Grammar School There is a quid pro quo , of course, in the benefit that mentors and other colleagues get from watching rookies make na\u00efve mistakes and offering guidance and advice from experience, at the same time tapping in to new ideas and reconnecting to the principles of pedagogy that are fresh in the student teachers' thinking. This was articulated in both schools I visited today by the supporting teachers who played their important part in bringing about fair and just evaluation of how their charges have progressed. Queensferry CHS, in the fog There was a thick fog for my journey across the Forth to Queensferry and I almost bottled doing the sketch because I don't know how to draw fog. I had a word with myself and thought, \"just put the pen marks where it's dark, and don't put them where it's light\". Easier said than, done, I think, so I diverted myself by trying to capture a couple of figures approaching the pool of light from the lamp. I remember a sketcher artist I follow said that figures add interest to a sketch. I think they are right, but I prefer the Leith rat, if I'm honest. Deans CHS again Back to Deans again and a view from a different part of the car park. It's interesting how varied these buildings can look, depending on where you look from. My wife calls my style \"Roobarb\", for the unsteady hand that wiggles the lines. I did get an 'O' level many years ago in technical drawing, so I do know how to use a ruler but when I'm trying to work quickly -- none of these sketches took more than about 10 minutes -- the look is more one of impression than technical accuracy. I was conscious that I was cold sitting in the car at Deans and so the lines were more Roobarb than usual, perhaps. More figure suggestions, though, and they seem to be growing on me. I'm quite pleased with the silver birch, too, given that I'm not giving myself time to make 10,000 strokes for the leaves. Dingwall A long but pleasant drive up beyond Inverness took me to new territory, and once more found me shaking hands with colleagues who had passed through my tutorials at Moray House. It's lovely to see the products of my labour thriving and making their mark on young people across the country. I am taking all the credit, of course, as I will for the superb teacher whose lesson on nuclear fission was one of the best I have ever seen. It's not all me, of course: a lot of work goes in to becoming a teacher, especially a good one, and you have to bring a lot of things, too. Attitude, aptitude, wit, intelligence, humour, resilience, just to mention a few. Those who bring all of that with them perhaps don't need much from me to succeed, but I do like to tell myself that I help them excel. Broxburn Academy As the weeks of touring schools come to an end for this session at least, I feel that I have been inspired by students, colleagues and the young people in schools. The student teachers have a steep learning curve, especially on their first school placement. Workload can be an issue, and both schools and the university urge the students to try to find a good, healthy, sustainable balance. I asked some of them what their \"secret\" is for managing this. All said that the balance is crucial to survival, and that part of that is remaining physically active through sport or exercise. Some of them run; others swim or play a sport. This advice I took myself today by going for a run in the early morning darkness. Vehicles are often a challenge for schools at the beginning and end of the day, even more so when parking is limited, so the final visit of the tour found me arriving at my destination later than planned. I parked in a quiet residential area and enjoyed a walk through the catchment instead of having time to sketch. By now, I was thinking that although every school is different, I had probably sketched enough fairly-recently-built school buildings to have a good appreciation for their character.","title":"School sketches"},{"location":"Stories/2022/2022-12-10-dunning-leven/","tags":["Fuji X"],"text":"Linlithgow Academy","title":"Winter light"},{"location":"tags/","text":"Index Henri Cartier-Bresson Your first 10,000 photographs are your worst.
