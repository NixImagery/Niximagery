    "text": "The summer is going down fighting, with thunder, rain, heat and humidity to set the mood. Injuries and the conflict between living and working raging, both raising anxiety levels. We deceided we needed an escape for a couple of hours and so bolted to a safe space, the same beach we were on in the last post, but approached from the other direction this time. We parked in the Temple car park at Lower Largo.\n\n\n\nGate\n\n\nThe walk northward along the beach from the car park is a delight for shed people like us. The houses along the front have little gardens, usually with some kind of shelter or writer’s retreat on the side facing the Forth. Some are painted to match the house. The gate above guards a flight of stone steps up to one of the gardens.\n\n\n\nLower Largo\n\n\nI took one camera, my Fuji X-T5 with the superb XF35mm f/2 lens and my sketching kit. I would say that I am a person of many interests and hobbies, and no time to pursue any of them properly. As far as sketching is concerned, I know, from friends and every piece of advice I’ve read, that always having your sketching kit with you is essential to the development of skills.\n\n\n\nAcross the forth\n\n\nWhat has dawned on me lately is that it is not enough to have the stuff with you, you actually have to get it out and use it. So, taking the opportunity to rest a while, I sketched the scene before me, looking across the Forth towards the capital, using a Waterman fountain pen. It looked unfinished, so I added some water colour. Not sure I got the colours right, and the lighter blue was definitely a stroke too far. The fountain pen ink isn’t waterproof, it seems. Note to self: sketch in pencil.\nI’m not sure about the finished sketch, it looks too contrasty to me, with the additional brush fineliner outlines added along the far shore. Mustn’t be discouraged, though, I am deliberately trying to develop the ability to sketch at speed and en plein air. Those arty friends of mine encourage me to keep going and I am thankful for their advice. It can only improve, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWillowherb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeasels\n\n\n\n\n\nThe walk back along the path above the beach is a delight for its richness of wild flowers and birdsong. The yellowhammers, robins and crows were close by as we walked back towards the car, singing of the joy and privileges we enjoy living here.\n\n\n\nDog rose"

    "text": "Where we live in Fife, we are very lucky indeed to have easy access to some of the most delightful coastal towns and villages anywhere in Britain. Earlier this week, we decided to take a hurl up to Dumbarnie Links, a long beach to the East of Largo. We parked at Drumeldrie and walked down the farm track to where it joins the Fife Coastal Path.\n\n\n\nOats and Thistle\n\n\nThe fields are busy and well used in this part of the world. Walking along the pathways between them, it is the exceptions that stand out. The rogue thistle or poppies that spring up between the cash crops are not unwelcome, of course. The thistle, a national emblem, is loved as much by the people as the pollinators.\n\n\n\nField Poppies\n\n\nPoppies are, for several generations, the great reminder of what was lost a century ago in The Great War and in conflicts since. Nevertheless, they are welcome throughout this time of year and will, as always, be symbolic as we move towards November.\n\n\n\nLone poppy\n\n\nWe have seen purple blankets across the countryside recently, and have learned that these are Lacy Phacelia, a “green manure” that is planted to improve the soil. Our farmers look to the future and farm responsibly and I am thankful they do.\n\n\n\nLacy Phacelia and Barley\n\n\nThe colours of the Fife countryside are breathtaking, and especially when enhanced by the gentle buzzing of the bees; the calls of raptors in the sky and of yellowhammers flitting along the hedgerows.\n\n\n\nLacy Phacelia and Barley and wild oats\n\n\nThe journey home was interrupted by a visit to Pittenweem for the best fish and chips you can find anywhere, and an ice cream stroll along the harbour.\n\n\n\nHeron in Pittenweem Harbour\n\n\nLike many harbours along the East Neuk, Pittenweem is endearing, remembers its own history, and sits comfortably alongside the native wildlife with which it is symbiotic.\n\n\n\nPittenweem Panorama\n\n\nApart from the alliteration, I like this stitch of two images taken from the walk up to the car park overlooking the bay from the South. You get a sense of the changing weather, I think. It wasn’t cold but there was that uncertainty of July in Scotland, where you never quite know what to wear on an outdoor trip. No complaints, though, and it could certainly have been worse; climate change affects us all now."

    "text": "Finally, a return to old habits as we took a road trip to Yellowcraigs, with a picnic and camera kit, blanket and a book to waste a couple of hours on a favourite beach. It has been some time since we did this and we both had been feeling a little guilty about it, I think. There seem to be too many distractions.\n\n\n\nDog rose X-T5, XF35 f2, f/4 at 1/250s\n\n\nThe walk to the beach through the grassy dunes sets the mood quite nicely, as does the soundscape of children and families playing in this well-kept resort. The car parking machines are up to date so you can pay with your phone, as you can also pay the ice-cream man. What has the world come to?\n\n\n\nFidra from Yellowcraigs, X-T5, XF90 f2, f/8 at 1/250s\n\n\nFrom our chosen spot, we had a good view of Fidra and Stevenson’s first lighthouse. His cousin is said to have based the map of Treasure Island on Fidra, the author having been a frequent visitor to this beach. I took the courage to reach for a notebook and a pocket pack of new watercolours bought on a whim at TK Max on the way round the bypass, to sketch the island from where we had pitched ourselves. The photograph above was taken knee-deep in the cool water of Forth shore.\n\n\n\nFidra from Yellowcraigs, watercolour and fineliner\n\n\nI am determined to sketch but lack the confidence of all these sketchnoters and en plein air urban artists; that’s not to say I’m not encouraged and inspired by what they do. As with my photography in recent years, I am finding real satisfaction in not doing it for anyone but myself. I try to capture, within my technical limitations, the feeling of a place or subject, rather than a soulless documenting of what they looked like. You can stop listing the differences between the photo and the sketch now.\n\n\n\nYellowcraigs beach X-T5, XF90 f2, f/2 at 1/2000s\n\n\nNature herself will not be beaten, of course. Any attempt at capturing emotion is likely to fail for there is nothing quite like being there. Having been there, in real life or in the imagination, allows the emotion to be triggered by an image. The beach grass here gives a sense of being in a safe place from which to observe the people beyond on the shore playing in the sunshine. Your response may be different, but that’s OK.\n\n\n\nStevenson’s memory X-T5, XF35 f2, f/2.8 at 1/1000s\n\n\nThis quill put me in mind of the writers and artists that had frequented this place over many years; I felt a connection with them, reaching for the words, loading their brushes with water and pigment to capture the fugitive shapes in the water or sky."

On the road, a folorn looking phone box stood mocking the advance of technology and the flatline mobile signal here, which is actually part of the attraction.\n It’s good to talk X-T5, f/11 at 1/30s4\nAlthough it wasn’t the weather to visit the singing sands (it apparently needs to be dry), we took a test drive to the car park at the start of the walking route that takes you there, at Arivegaig.\n The family X-T2, 1/125s, f/7.1, 400mm5\nOn the way down, we noted how rich the wildlife is here in comparison with other places we’ve been up and down the western highlands. After the eagle this morning, other birds had made their presence felt, as had the deer. The deer camouflage seems to make them confident and relaxed close to the fairly quiet roads. Sheep are confident, too, ambling along and disrespecting the passing places. They don’t need camouflage. They seem to think they are indestructible, like Edinburgh pedestrians. We eat a lot more lamb than we do venison, just saying.\n\n Kinlochmoidart pier X-T5, f/16 at 1/30s, ISO400\nI couldn’t resist this photogenic old pier on the road beside Loch Moidart’s glistening green sandbanks. We may return, having overheard in a restaurant this evening that it’s a good place for otters."

It is green on account of the damp and slippery approaches that kept the castle safe for so long from attackers.

A most furious and sanguinary hand-to-hand fight ensued.

The sand doesn’t actually sing, by the way – it’s more of a squeak when you walk on dry stretches of it. From the car park by Arivegaig, the walk took us past the southern edge of Kentra Bay and through forestry and down to the beach. By the time we got there, all had left but a couple of wild campers who gave us a cheery wave from their lookout above the beach. They must have had a better handle on the weather, which turned to gusty rain for the 6km walk back to the car.\n The Singing Sands Screenshot from video playback\nIt’s no hardship: I was told by a lawyer once that in Scotland, we believe that a little suffering is good for you.

Part of the cliff at the end of the harbour is no longer safe to walk along but it is easy to access the coastal walk through a short tunnel in the cliff at the end of the wall.\nDysart Harbour Wall\nA shed by the harbour was eclectically decorated with harboury stuff, and really set the feel of the place.\nWe arrived at feeding time for the boats, and they seemed to think we had treats for them.\nThe wall again, because it is fascinating. The landscape of it seemed other-worldly.\nPlenty of things to look at in a harbour. There were people working, moving boats, furling sails and so on, and just as many sitting on benches. There were benches everywhere we looked today and I think I like that. Perhaps we are becoming more reflective."

The ice cream was easy, Giacopazzi’s in Kinross providing a very nice solution. Cookies and Cream for him, Peach Melba for her.\n Loch Leven Fuji X-T2, 35mm f/2. Stitch of four images.\nOnwards to a partly aimless drive to explore some favourite roads: through Milnathort, out by Tillyrie and Athron Hill where we had a look at a housing development seriously out of our range. Who needs a house that big anyway?\n Stronachie Forest X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4\nOn an easy walk at Stronachie, all of our senses were exercised. The air was rich in oxygen from the forest, perfumed with heather; the air crackled as the broom seed pods burst open in the warm late summer sun.\n Broom seed pods\nI changed the lens on the Fuji for the Stronachie walk, having started with the compact and versatile Fuji 35mm f/2, for my Nikon 85mm f/1.4. This is a difficult lens to focus wide open but it makes quite creamy bokeh washes from the background colours, even in low light.\n Plenty of room in the forest f/1.4 at 1600 ISO\nThe Nikon lens is well known for its flare, too. This rainbow effect from shooting into the light is caused by internal flare in the lens.\n Rainbow flare\nThe Fuji X equivalent lens, the 90mm f/2, doesn’t have the same flare or bokeh as the much older Nikon. It’s not reasonable to compare them, perhaps, because of their age difference. Both are designed as portrait lenses.\n Stronachie Forest X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4\nHow fortunate we are to live within reach of such wonders of nature."

    "text": "On the day of the King’s proclamation, and in need of some sea air, we took a run up the coast to Lower Largo. It’s been a challenging week for us in one way and another, not least for the depth of emotion we felt at the death of the Queen. There have been other losses, of course, but this one seems to have brought home Joni Mitchell’s statement of the obvious: you don’t know what you’ve got ’til it’s gone.\n\nWe walked along the upper path, it being near high tide, to a favourite spot on the beach beside what looks like a rockery arrangement for a garden. The waters swirled around the rocks and the sun passed slowly, ever lower in the sky as autumn progresses, reminding us again of the relentless march of time. Not yet ready to forget the dog days of summer, the sun shone warmly.\n\nWe sat for a while, the tide shifting the shapes and scenery with sand and seaweed. Sea kayaks passed out in the Forth, with the dead offshore platform Sedco 711 breaking up the horizon. Sunlight sparkled and shimmered on the water as time, ralenti, became all but suspended in the reverie.\n\nThere’s nothing like a beach, and no better beach than a Scottish beach, to purge stress and anxiety, those corrosive curses of the contemporary condition. After the passage of some indeterminate time, things are just better than they were; big things smaller; a feeling of coming home settles.\n\nAs we walked along the path, the soothing splash of the waves on the shore below provided headspace in which to process and park our reflections on the week’s events and resolutions were quietly packed in their pockets, ready for when we will need them.\n Teasels\n\nI’ve learned that home isn’t a place, it’s a feeling. — Cecelia Ahern in Love, Rosie"

    "text": "Earlier in the year, we booked a dinner-bed-and-breakfast deal for Christmas Eve’s eve, as much for corporeal as spiritual health. Before he knew what was happening, the cat was dropped at his aunties’ place and we were in our favourite winter woodland. The intention was to unwind on the approach to Christmas Day; to hit pause on the processes of work, study, shopping and the rest. It worked a charm. We didn’t book the suite we had when we were married at the Dunkeld House Hotel but our room was enough for the purpose.\n The Hermitage Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4 lens.\nThere was plenty of time to enjoy a slow wander around the Hermitage before check-in. We took cameras, but not the usual paraphernalia of tripods and filters. Very soon, the life-giving oxygen of the trees respiring reached our lungs and Mother Nature cwtched us both. That feeling never gets old and before long we were on speaking terms with the residents again.\n\n Notices seem to have discouraged the previously trending habit of visitors forcing coins into any tree stump. Like most popular excesses, it’s neither healthy nor tasteful, like those repetitive memes you see. I’m glad the coin habit seems to be on the wane, even if the endless banality of social media is anything but. Oh, look, there’s yet another New Year’s resolution.\nThe soundscape on a walk around the Hermitage trail is varied, especially in the winter when the River Braan is swollen with meltwater from the recent snow. I didn’t record it: it’s white noise in a browser. Perhaps the picture will help you hear the rushing of the whitewater over rocks on the fall by Ossian’s Hall.\n\nOn the other side of the A9, the Tay wanders beside the hotel, altogether a more dignified spectacle than the its manic neighbour, the Braan. Alongside that river is the “dookit” or stone structure where we were married in the gentle Perthshire rainfall, with poetry and music and prayer. We walked down to remind ourselves and renew the feelings of that day. It was beautiful, of course.\n\nSo, now, I write this on the “other side” of the Christmas celebrations we were preparing ourselves for; the joys and excesses, catechisms and exchanges of gifts, avoided topics, revelations and ghosts of those departed. That one night away, to worship in the cathedral of nature, to enjoy someone else cooking, to be ourselves for ourselves, was not only the perfect preparation for the bacchanalian feast, but also a shahada for the year ahead.\n Nature’s Cathedral Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4 lens."

A place to read, reflect, walk and enjoy life together. Not far from Hawick, the Summer House offers all of that and more.\nThe Summer House from the lake\nThis place has been fairly recently renovated and is cosy, warm and spacious enough for families and small groups to enjoy the stunning countryside here. There is a lake close by with swans and moorhens. A young deer met us on the driveway as we headed on to the estate. Owls serenaded the night.

The Summer House includes artefacts of the three Abrahamic faiths of Islam, Christianity and Judaism.\n The Basmala appears at threshholds to the old and new summerhouse. The older summer house is in the walled garden, which is well tended by the gardner and a team of volunteers who give service as a form of study and reflection. Quotes from Bulent Rauf and others suggest that central to the teachings of the Institute is unity of life and self discovery. On the hill above the house is the Monument to Man:\n The Monument to Man above the estate has engraved around the circumference, “ALL ARE FROM HIM AND TO HIM THEY RETURN”, resonant with similar phrases in the Bible (e.g. Romans 11:36) and the Qu’ran (e.g. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:156). In the ground near to the monument, with its four pillars representing Chisholme’s own pillars of work, study, meditation and zikr, is a circular stone bearing the inscription:\n\nO CONFIDENT SOUL, RETURN TO YOUR LORD, AGREEING AND AGREED TO ENTER AMONG MY SERVANTS AND ENTER MY PARADISE\n\nThis is a variation of another well known passage from the Qu’ran, Surah 89, Al-Fajr (Dawn, verses 26 – 30)."

Our weekend at the summer house gave us time and space to discuss things that concern us and things that make us. We took time and space to see ourselves more clearly and shared life and laughter. We resolved to act, and to not act, on these things. Chisholme draws on Lao Tsu for some of its teaching, describing it:\n\nThe philosophy of Lao Tsu is simple: Accept what is in front of you without wanting the situation to be other than it is. Study the natural order of things and work with it rather than against it, for to try to change what is only sets up resistance.\n\nI think this understates Lao Tsu’s recognition of man’s free will and ability to use it. On the way home, we took advice from the Hadith:\n\nAnas ibn Malik reported: A man said, “O Messenger of Allah, should I tie my camel and trust in Allah, or should I leave her untied and trust in Allah?” The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Tie her and trust in Allah.”\nSource: Sunan al-Tirmidhī 2517"

The more it tells you the less you know.\n– Diane Arbus\nSpeaking of Kings, we went for a walk in Pittencrieff Park (known locally as “The Glen”). We were hunting for autumn leaves for an artsy project, specifically Oak. A walk in a park is never a bad idea in my book, and it gave me a chance to re-introduce myself to the big Fuji XF100-400mm zoom lens that I got back from service and repair this week.\nDunfermline Abbey\nKing Charles III recently formally conferred city status on Dunfermline, during his first joint royal visit with the Queen Consort since the death of Queen Elizabeth. The townsfolk turned out for the occasion, which is nice, even if some were apparently a little unkind to our First Minister. I couldn’t possibly comment.\nThe Abbey and Abbey Church were basking in the early autumn glow. I love how the light played around the buttresses of this old place, which has quite a history. Walking down into the Glen, the colurs in the Japanese Garden were no less magical.\nJapanese Acer\nThe contrast was strong as we explored some of the nooks and crannies. Sunlight danced on water and dappled through the leaves, reflecting and re-reflecting greens and reds, oranges and yellows between dark and mysterious Tolkienesque shadows.\nThe Waterfall on Tower Burn.\nWhat the Americans call a Sqrl. There are plenty of these in and around Dunfermline (squirrels, although there are a fair number of Americans, even at this time of year). They have a sense of humour, of course, and will run right across the feet of anyone with a camera just to watch them fumble for focus and fail.\nAlliums in the formal garden. We walked here after pausing for a breakfast roll at the Peacock Room, and chatting to an old friend I hadn’t seen for 20 years. That was a pleasant surprise and oddly, enabled me to fill in a couple of gaps from a particular period in my life. Nothing major, more an ironing out of wrinkles in a shirt I haven’t worn for a while, but a resolution nonetheless.\nThis iconic peacock is one of a number in the park. There is a new enclosure following the recent mindless attack that resulted in the injury of one bird and the death of another, Malcolm, named for the King whose wife Margaret established the Abbey. More help is needed to support the volunteers who put heart and soul into caring for these beautiful creatures. If you can help, please drop them a few quid. Thank you, and thanks for reading."

    "text": "During late November and early December, my job has required me to make visits to schools. The schedule can be challenging so I always try to arrive around 20 minutes early so as to check any messages, and enter the school with grace and dignity. On this cycle of visits, I thought I’d use the extra time to also practice some sketching.\n Linlithgow Academy\nThere is a rationale for this habit. Sketching is a deliberate, mindful process, even when done quickly. It helps you see what is there, and the looking doesn’t stop when the sketchbook is closed. At Linlithgow, I found myself studying wall displays, people, the dynamic of school reception spaces, looking at shapes and patterns as much as inscriptions. I even got the chance to assist some not-yet-detective material police officers in their hunt for the reception desk, being able to indicate the huge sign that my fine-tuned sketcher’s observational skills had spotted in the lobby.\n Deans Community High School\nWe continue to invest in building new schools to replace older, more out of date infrastructure. This is a good thing for many reasons including sending a message to the country that education is important and valuable to us all. Whilst every school is different, certain design features and material choices appear in many of the recent builds, perhaps dating them. This is not to say they look the same – they do, in some respects, but each has its own features according to the perceived needs of the community they serve.\n Kirkcaldy High School\nI taught Physics and Mathematics at Kirkcaldy High School for a number of years before replacing my own tutor at Moray House. I’m not going to reminisce about this old place but it was nice to go back for a visit and see friends and former colleagues again. I was reminded that cultures are slow to change and that whilst rolling stones may gather no moss, they do gather experience you don’t get standing still.\n Preston Lodge High School\nBunsen burners, magnesium strips and good dialogic pedagogy made my job easy at Preston Lodge today. All the nicer to see more old friends, too. Education is a village, and once you’ve been at it a while, it can feel like going home when you meet again, people who have shared different parts of your journey. Conversations pick up where they left off, friendship hugs shock the pupils, and mutual respect is grown and shared from stories of careers unfolding. I love it when new teachers see that: they are enculturated into their vocation through the modelled behaviours of those that go before them, and shape them. There’s more to this than Vygotksy, or Bruner, or the latest educational fad.\n Portobello High School\nPreston Lodge and Portobello sketches are not the best likeness to the real thing, for similar reasons. At Preston Lodge, my view from the car was obscured by a large van and so I had to interpret and sketch what I felt was there. Isn’t that the point, though? The American photographer David Alan Harvey said, “Don’t shoot what it looks like. Shoot what it feels like.” This is my motivation in photography as much as in sketching, and exploring that idea is the principal reason for me wanting to sketch more often. At Portobello, a different large van also obscured the view, and I don’t have the confidence quite to stand in a car park sketching, in full view of the CCTV. I had a call to go in to school anyway, so I took a quick photo on my phone and sketched it up later in a café over lunch. From this experience, I think I do a better job sketching live, en plein air, than from a photo. Something seems to be missing in my drawing from a photo, at least where my skills are at present. Perhaps that will change with practice.\n The lorry at Leith, with a fast rat\nLeith Academy has a nice front façade but you can’t see it from where I parked, and the back of the building is ugly, so I sketched the random lorry in the car park instead. I did not find out what the vehicle does, or why it’s there, but it looks arty to me, even if it seems past its best service days. Leith has always felt like an arty school: it has interesting shaped science labs which are full of scope and character, even if some of the electrical infrastructure also seems past its best service days. The teachers are anything but, of course, nor the businesslike head teacher who introduced himself as I was preparing to leave for my next appointment. It’s great that there are schools like Leith who put the effort and investment into new teachers, for the wider good of Scottish education.\n Musselburgh Grammar School\nThere is a quid pro quo, of course, in the benefit that mentors and other colleagues get from watching rookies make naïve mistakes and offering guidance and advice from experience, at the same time tapping in to new ideas and reconnecting to the principles of pedagogy that are fresh in the student teachers’ thinking. This was articulated in both schools I visited today by the supporting teachers who played their important part in bringing about fair and just evaluation of how their charges have progressed.\n Queensferry CHS, in the fog\nThere was a thick fog for my journey across the Forth to Queensferry and I almost bottled doing the sketch because I don’t know how to draw fog. I had a word with myself and thought, “just put the pen marks where it’s dark, and don’t put them where it’s light”. Easier said than, done, I think, so I diverted myself by trying to capture a couple of figures approaching the pool of light from the lamp. I remember a sketcher artist I follow said that figures add interest to a sketch. I think they are right, but I prefer the Leith rat, if I’m honest.\n Deans CHS again\nBack to Deans again and a view from a different part of the car park. It’s interesting how varied these buildings can look, depending on where you look from. My wife calls my style “Roobarb”, for the unsteady hand that wiggles the lines. I did get an ‘O’ level many years ago in technical drawing, so I do know how to use a ruler but when I’m trying to work quickly – none of these sketches took more than about 10 minutes – the look is more one of impression than technical accuracy. I was conscious that I was cold sitting in the car at Deans and so the lines were more Roobarb than usual, perhaps. More figure suggestions, though, and they seem to be growing on me. I’m quite pleased with the silver birch, too, given that I’m not giving myself time to make 10,000 strokes for the leaves.\n Dingwall\nA long but pleasant drive up beyond Inverness took me to new territory, and once more found me shaking hands with colleagues who had passed through my tutorials at Moray House. It’s lovely to see the products of my labour thriving and making their mark on young people across the country. I am taking all the credit, of course, as I will for the superb teacher whose lesson on nuclear fission was one of the best I have ever seen. It’s not all me, of course: a lot of work goes in to becoming a teacher, especially a good one, and you have to bring a lot of things, too. Attitude, aptitude, wit, intelligence, humour, resilience, just to mention a few. Those who bring all of that with them perhaps don’t need much from me to succeed, but I do like to tell myself that I help them excel.\n Broxburn Academy\nAs the weeks of touring schools come to an end for this session at least, I feel that I have been inspired by students, colleagues and the young people in schools. The student teachers have a steep learning curve, especially on their first school placement. Workload can be an issue, and both schools and the university urge the students to try to find a good, healthy, sustainable balance. I asked some of them what their “secret” is for managing this. All said that the balance is crucial to survival, and that part of that is remaining physically active through sport or exercise. Some of them run; others swim or play a sport. This advice I took myself today by going for a run in the early morning darkness.\nVehicles are often a challenge for schools at the beginning and end of the day, even more so when parking is limited, so the final visit of the tour found me arriving at my destination later than planned. I parked in a quiet residential area and enjoyed a walk through the catchment instead of having time to sketch. By now, I was thinking that although every school is different, I had probably sketched enough fairly-recently-built school buildings to have a good appreciation for their character."

    "text": "Winter has its attractions, even if it isn’t all frosty and picturesque by the time we’re up and about. The camera is often the excuse to get up off the couch and out of the house, side benefits being clearing of the head and lungs, stretching of muscle and tendon and general wellbeing. This is true even if the photographs don’t turn out well. Or even if no photographs are taken at all, and the cameras effectively become ballast. Professional, I am not.\n Inchcolm Abbey, Fuji X-T5, XF100-400mm\nThat’s not to say I can’t swan about with a massive zoom lens and look like a professional. I did this on a short run to the Braefoot Bay marine terminal by Aberdour. We walked up to the Monk’s Cave, from where I zoomed in on the Abbey on Inchcolm island in the Forth. At 400mm, the foreshortening brings the distant ski slope much closer and amplifies the haze effect.\n Eurasian Curlew\nThe whole point of having the big lens on is to try to take photos of living things, which, being long time survivors of Man’s 7 million year evolution, know to keep a distance between themselves and a bloke in a bobble hat. I was pleased enough with this, quite possibly my first reasonable wildlife photograph. A combination of the long lens and my new X-T5’s 40MPixel file size gave scope for a crop which I think still renders nicely on screen.\n “Nevermore!”\nThese characters are everywhere, or at least, I hope it’s not the same one following me around. Again, a crop from a zoomed in image which allowed me to cover my composition errors. I forget who it was who said that they never crop, always capturing the intended photograph in the viewfinder. There’s elegence in that idea that I admire but I suspect that not many world-class captures use every pixel that hits the sensor. There’s legitimate art in the post-capture processing and adjustments, I think.\n Fuji X-T2, Nikon A-iS 85mm f/1.4\nI love the textures everywhere. My wife and I discussed what this image might be called and couldn’t really think of anything we could put on a public website. I’m just going to move along to the grasses at the edge of the tide’s reach along the shore, which offer movement and colour.\n Fuji X-T2, Nikon A-iS 85mm f/1.4\nI want to call this, “Neapolitan” for the bands of colour, like ice cream.\n The Bridges Fuji X-T2, Nikon A-iS 85mm f/1.4\nWe meandered home past the rising tide today and, looking back towards the bridges, across the sands of Pettycur Bay, felt thankful for all the privilege we enjoy, living close by to these amazing places."

    "text": "The February half-term break gave us the opportunity to head back to the Lake District for a few days of walking and exploration. We’d been to Patterdale several times and love the care that has been given to the preservation and development of the area. The Lakes have a distinct feel to them; it’s in the stones, and the local businesses, and even the vehicles.\n Patterdale, Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4\n The dark skies on our first night confounded the weather forecast and were a treat, and a challenge to our photography as we wrestled with remembering how to capture a night sky. Street lamps, industry, intruder lights and the like all usually conspire to deny the humbling sight of stars and galaxies overhead, and so I was certainly out of practice. I was reasonably pleased with this image, with the Orion Nebula, or NGC 1976 clearly seen as a smudge below Orion’s belt near the centre of the picture. NGC 1976 is a region of star formation, over 1,000 light-years away from us and yet still within our own Galaxy, the Milky Way. Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\n Goldrill Beck river, Patterdale Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\nOur home-from-home was on the road over the Goldrill Beck river on good walking routes. The bridge over the river is a classic spot to capture the iconic pastoral view looking Northwest towards Ullswater.\n Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\nThere were plenty of timeless sights to drink in as we walked the paths around the Southern end of Ullswater, which, if we had to state a preference, would be our favourite end. It feels more “Lake District”: walls are layered slates, buildings are, too. Raptors and smaller birds proudly converse and advertise their presence. People exchange pleasant conversation if they want to, or pass by, deep in their reveries. Others peek at you from behind walls, curious.\n Fuji X-T2, XF100-400mmF4.5-5.6 R\nWe didn’t venture too far on this trip, spending more time on our feet than in the car exploring. Sometimes we do more “drive-by shooting” in areas we don’t know too well, so as to try to get a sense of a place. That often doesn’t work but this break, we went slower, and breathed the place in better. Oh, for the life that gives the fullest opportunity for breathing places in.\n Brothers Water Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\nAt Aira Force (meaning waterfall, from Old Norse), we bimbled around snatching long and short exposures, chatting to other photographers who had travelled from far to capture a memory of the place. This is the kind of place that increasingly tests my surety of foot: the rocks are wet and slippery, paths are muddy, roots are deadly cunning. The effect of this environment is to slow me down even more now I’m older and less Weeble. This is a blessing: I see more.\n\n\n\n Aira Force Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\n\n\n Aira Force Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\n\n\n Air Force Fuji X-T2, XF100-400mm\n\n\n\n This is not to say that I see very much, of course. At Aira Force we saw or rather, heard then saw, a drone overhead with the owner standing aloof from danger on a nice dry, flat rock. The point of view from the mobile platform is always going to be better than wherever I can scramble to with my gear. The cameras in many of these devices are often on a par with any digital SLR. The Devil in me wanted first to throw a rock at the drone, then at the owner. Instead, I wondered whether drone photography is something else – something different to stills photography altogether. It’s a matter of choice and opportunity, I suppose, what medium an artist uses to tell a story. Images are part of that, perhaps, no matter how obtained, but the mental imagery they invoke might be more so.\nBuzzard, Fuji X-T2, XF100-400mm\n Chaffinch Fuji X-T2, XF100-400mm\nI carried two cameras as we walked; one for landscape, wider images, with a 16mm lens, and the other, with my monster Fuji XF100-400mmF4.5-5.6 R zoom to try to capture some of the wildlife. We saw more than I captured, including a much-signposted but not often seen red squirrel. The Air Force offered me a reminder to have the correct settings on at all times by flying low over Ullswater when I hadn’t (this jet was taken at 1/125s hand held on manual focus), but which helped me be a little more ready for robins and raptors.\n Fuji X-T2, XF100-400mm\nWe had planned the trip, sort of, by identifying some of the interesting places others had written about or shared. One of these was The Duke of Portland’s Boathouse at the Northern end of Ullswater, once the property of the 18th Century 3rd Duke of Portland, sold to save him from bankruptcy. Now, it’s a hugely overpriced holiday rental.\n The Duke of Portland’s Boathouse Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\nWe delayed the journey home after check-out time in order to enjoy a little serendipity. Driving up the Kirkstone Pass, I misunderstood the navigator and instead of turning into a car park at the top of the pass, headed down the road called “the Struggle” that leads to Ambleside and Lake Windermere. I pulled off the road to give us time to decide how far we would go down that road – we were not keen on visiting the denser touristy places, even at this time of year. When we checked the view, we decided it was a good place to eat the lunch we had bought in Glenridding.\n The Struggle Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\nWe continued further to explore, finding a couple of interesting old pines at the side of the road. This is beautifully circular, as we had been staying in a place called, “Wordsworth Barn”, so named for the poet who onced owned the barn that is now a holiday rental.\n\nWordsworth Barn was quite wonderful, although, at 6’4”, I enjoyed a close personal relationship with the old beams. That aside, the host, Joan, had thought cleverly about what her guests need to know and have when staying here. We had booked for our basic needs – wood-burning stove, self-contained, superb location and ease of access to the things we wanted to see – and Joan had taken care of all of the things we didn’t think to specify, like every kind of glass we might use; dressing gowns; a bath and a shower; a personal welcome; thoughtful use of space; fresh milk and a bottle of fizz. None of the usual irritations, either: fuel for the log burner is included, recycling is easy and intelligently organised, everything works (although a builder’s knack is required to unlock the front door). We will be back.\nWordsworth was well known for his love of trees (Dale and Yen, 2022) and “wished to be remembered as a tree hugger” (Yen, 2022). It seems appropriate to end this post with something written by Wordsworth whilst in the area, that seems to connect some of our experiences over the past few days:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten in March\n\n\n\nWhile resting on the Bridge at the Foot of Brother's Water.\n\nThe cock is crowing,  \nThe stream is flowing,  \nThe small birds twitter,  \nThe lake doth glitter,  \nThe green field sleeps in the sun;  \nThe oldest and youngest  \nAre at work with the strongest;  \nThe cattle are grazing,  \nTheir heads never raising;  \nThere are forty feeding like one!  \n\nLike an army defeated  \nThe snow hath retreated,  \nAnd now doth fare ill  \nOn the top of the bare hill;  \nThe Ploughboy is whooping–anon–anon:  \nThere’s joy in the mountains;  \nThere’s life in the fountains;  \nSmall clouds are sailing,  \nBlue sky prevailing;  \nThe rain is over and gone!\n\n-- William Wordsworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDale, Peter, and Brandon C.

Although there were plenty of photo opportunities, we did well to resist the temptation to reach for the phone and grab a gratuitous snap for the most part, anyway. The old town is too much of a temptation, however, so here are a few photos taken on my iPhone to share the experience of the excursion into Corfu Town.\n\n\n\nModern paving in the old style\n\n\nThe old town has a long history, dating back to the 8th century BC. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Walking the streets and narrow alleyways gives the feeling of many cultures: from the influence of the centuries of Venetian rule to the footsteps of those who have passed this way before.\n\n\n\nNear the new fortress\n\n\nThe town is also known as Korkyra and features two major fortresses, the “old” and “new”. We climbed to the New Fortress above the town and paid a few Euro to walk around it. New, it is not, dating back to the 16th century, a couple of hundred years after the “old” Fortress.\n\n\n\nTunnel into the New Fortress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Old Fortress…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n… from the New\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sketch in the square, waiting for the bus back…\n\n\n\n\n\n…to our hotel in Kommeno Bay.\n\n\n\n\n\nActually, not Corfu\n\n\nThe holiday continued once we returned home, smug as we were that it had rained the whole time we were away, only to get quite warm once we got back. This is not a picture of Corfu, but of our first breakfast at home. It’s good to be home again, with the warmth of the Corfu sunshine still in our skin."
