It’s nice to know there are still public-spirited folk out there.I decided not to be burdened with camera gear, so just took my little Afga Isolette, which had a few frames left in it of a roll of Fuji Pro400H, and a roll of Ilford Delta 3200 in my pocket.Part of the keep remains, Ilford Delta 3200A walk alongside the bunkers and greensward took us to one of our favourite haunts, Goblin Ha’. This magical place has been here for almost a thousand years and is full of stories and little hidey-places.

I’d struggled recently with film stock curling in the scanner, spoiling my efforts to make nice, in-focus images.

Compare the above image with this one:The crypt from outside, Fujifilm Pro 400HThis was a family outing: a chance for some of us to spend quality time together in this natural and mystical place, right for reflection.

      "content"  : "I lost my mum in March this year, just as COVID was descending on the world. As long as I remember, she had always been keen, sometimes too keen, to capture a moment in a photograph. I inherited a rich and wonderful collection of albums and shoe-boxes full of family memories, and of quite a lot of people I don’t recognise.Amongst her possessions was a little point-and-shoot automatic 35mm camera, a Premier PC-645D. It still had a film in it. I took the camera with me on a couple of trips, including our anniversary weekend to Dunkeld, where we had been married the year before. In some sense, it was a way of making up for her not being able to travel up to Scotland for our wedding: we had taken her the albums of the wedding to see before she was admitted to hospital on Christmas Eve 2019. For a short while this year, it was as if she was with us.Her final pictures were typical. This one, evidence of a mystery. A bungee strap had suddenly appeared with a clatter on the roof of her cottage one day, on the day a stowaway’s body was found in a Clapham garden. Mum was convinced that this strap had something to do with it and alerted the authorities, who took no interest. I told her that I thought it entirely feasible that the strap might be connected to the tragedy somehow.Bungee from the skyThe second is of three visitors to her little house in Letchworth, Michelle, Marilyn and Tracey, cousins on the Brennan side (my grandmother’s). Mum often had visitors; Michelle wrote of this visit:  I lost her phone number and we just went unannounced, but she still made us welcome. I’m so grateful we decided to go anyway as this was to be the last time we saw her. Letchworth captured my heart, and from the first time I went with my mum to re-unite with the cousins Audreys, I absolutely adored your mum, such a beautiful and fascinating lady. I will never forget all her advice, she taught me so much that I didn’t know about our family on the Brennan side, especially the ones that emigrated to Canada.Three visitorsWe took a trip along the coast near us, to Crail. Here’s my wife at work, and the kind of place mum would have enjoyed being if she were able to travel. Her health wasn’t the best, it never had been, but she never offered it as an excuse or let it prevent her from living the most fruitful and interesting life. The crashing waves on this rocky coast would have been right up her street.CrailFinally, on the weekend to Dunkeld, I took a selfie for mum of my wife and I in the mirror in our suite, not taking into account the flash on this little point-and-shoot, “focus free” camera. I can’t help thinking that the flare somehow indicates her presence with us on that day as we celebrated our anniversary, and remembered a remarkable woman.Is that you?"

This year, autumn was on time and the Hermitage forest was just magnificent and we had time to enjoy it properly.I’ve never used infra-red sensitive film before so I did a bit of reading about it before the trip: on the day, I put a Neewer IR720 filter on and took about 6 stops off the exposure estimates. I metered at ISO 200, which is the box speed for this film in visible light.The Hermitage forestThe exposures looked a couple of stops under when I got the film back from AG Labs, but there was plenty of detail available in the negatives to lift out.

It was a bright, partly sunny day, and I took some of the shots at 1/50 s hand-held, although some were at 1/200 s or between these two. Apertures were between f/8 and f/16, mostly. I finished the film and sent it to AG for developing with another E100 I had recently finished in my Fuji GW690ii.The transparencies were scanned in an Epson V600. At 6400 dpi, this yields a file around 750 MB in size, and an image approaching 250 megapixels, but this is not anything like equivalent to “better than a Fuji GFX” unless the camera and photographer have combined to capture the absolute highest quality image possible. I certainly am not consistently getting that kind of precision, even if the camera can, but it won’t stop me trying. I scanned these at 3200 dpi for an image nearer 50 Megapixels in a file under 200MB after cropping.Near Kinghorn beach. Adjusted for crop and wonky horizons in Iridient Developer. Size reduction for the web was in Apple’s Preview.Inchkeith Island. Cropped and adjusted in Iridient Developer.It’s not lost on me that a roll of this film, with processing, costs more than the camera did. I’m sure that’s not a unique situation but given that the Agfa Isolette is a medium format camera, and the quality of the capture and rendering are, in my view, pretty good, then I am left wondering why I am also happy, from time to time, to launch a grand or more on a digital camera. Maybe those days are over.The variation in exposures in this roll are certainly operator error. I do a lot of calculating while I shoot, having never developed any real “intuitive feel” for exposure over the years. There’s time yet – as Henri Cartier-Bresson says, “your first 10,000 photographs are your worst”."

Needless to say, I’ve had some results I am very pleased with, and a whole series of disappointments and frustrations with myself on the way.Focusing the FujiMy monster medium-format Fuji GW690ii (above, centre) is a rangefinder on steroids, one of a series of cameras known as the “Texas Leicas” on account of their size. They were made for Japanese bus tour customers, who got a souvenir snap of the group as they visited Mt. Fuji, or Kyoto, which was developed and printed in time for the end of the trip. The huge 6cm x 9cm negatives it produces are large enough to render detail from the fixed 90mm lens even when enlarged and printed for the office wall. I bought a “near mint” one from ODA-Japan at the end of 2019 for over £500 including taxes and fees. From the listing:  Grade: Near Mint - Pre-owned, minimal signs of use. Appearance is very beautiful, tiny scuffs from normal use. It shows signs of use. *Please check photos. New Light Seals!! Optics: Beautiful condition.None of those words, I have learned, describe the camera. I had been disappointed with some of the photos taken with it. This, for example, taken on Kinghorn Beach, I hoped would be much clearer:Parasurfers, Kinghorn BeachSometimes sharpness doesn’t matter too much. This image, taken on a trip to the Faroes before the COVID lockdown, still looks pretty nice to me, not least because the Portra film I was using is just wonderful if you catch the light right:Huts near VágarTwo Nikon FMsMy old Nikon FM, which went everywhere I did as I travelled with the military and then work from 1977 to the turn of the century, had been condemned by Lehmans as being beyond repair, specifically, the shutter mechanism, for which no spares are available. Its “FULLY TESTED EXCELLENT” replacement I had bought from SE Cameras (eBay) has never been right, showing light leaks and odd exposure variations. Here’s an example:Kinghorn, Nikon FMThe light leaks were particularly bad in a recent film - 20 of the 36 exposures were spoiled - and this is what triggered me to finally take action and get professional help.The CLAPractice makes perfect, they say, and they also say that a bad workman blames his tools. That said, I bet even Chippendale launched more than one of his chisels across the workshop on his learning journey. Ergo, I decided recently to get these cameras “CLA”-ed, or clean, lubricate, and adjust-ed.I took the two Nikons and the Fuji to a little repair shop in Morningside, Edinburgh and asked, if possible, for them to make one good camera out of the two Nikons, and fix any focusing problems there might be in the Fuji. All I really wanted to know is whether the criticism I have had of recent photographs is all down to poor technique, or whether it might - just might - be something to do with the camera.I picked up the three cameras today, all in excellent working order, with a clear list of things that had been done to them and an assurance (and a reasonable limited warranty) that they are “to specification”. Can’t wait to get out with some film in them.Lessons learned  Don’t buy from eBay and expect things to be as described  Get cameras that are new to you, checked and serviced  Get your CLA done by a reputable, local repair shopRecommended suppliersI buy (too much) film from Analogue Wonderland, and get it developed at AG Photolab, who have been brilliant in helping me make sense of some of the recent exposure problems.Cameratiks in Edinburgh is staffed by calm, competent and polite people who know what they are doing. They are not cheap, nor are they expensive: you can buy quality digital and film gear there, and have them offer decent advice on the basis that you will go back there next time you need anything.

We took a look at Achmelvich beach after settling in to the apartment we had AirBnB’d for a few nights. Everything seems booked up, which seems weird, given that there are almost no overseas visitors to these shores at present and the roads are almost utterly empty.Achmelvich beachWe returned to Achmelvich a couple of times, well, because we love it, even if the weather doesn’t always love us. The machair is in full bloom at the moment. The local people care for it by mowing swards through the meadow-like grass to encourage visitors not to trample randomly over the new growth. There are visitors here apart from ourselves: I edited out the tent on the beach in the next photo, because camping isn’t allowed on the beach at Achmelvich.Achmevlich beach (long exposure)Achmevlich beach (Panchro 400). The figure in the grass is Kara.Stac PollaidhWe took the walking route around Stac Pollaidh. There’s a new, lottery-funded, improved path here to protect the slopes and give the old well-trodden path a chance to recover.Going up Stac Pollaidh, looking EastGoing up Stac Pollaidh, looking SouthAlthough we hadn’t really intended to, we took the higher path, and reached the ridge near the top, which in retrospect, is something we feel good about. Going the last few metres higher required better climbing experience, gear, or stupidity. Fortunately, we had left ours at the fork in the lower path.On the ridge on Stac PollaidhThe Coigach peninsulaOn a long meandering drive around the Coigach peninsula, the light changed constantly. Waze told us we were 2 hours from our apartment as we turned for home, yet only 37 km distant. This is because, perhaps, the twisty single-track roads ought to be driven only at 20 kph. The streams and foliage, deer and passing places pass by the window even at that speed, every now and then opening up wide open skies, the cotton grass stretching to the distant hills.Road to Achnahaird Bay… and the ever-present sheep.Two wanderersStoer and ClachtollThis holiday was a good way to get familiar with a new car and I felt comfortable enough after a day or so to take it off-road down to a fisheries bothy at Stoer. We got chatting to a ranger when were here last October about whales and dolphins. We had promised to send the Mercedes dealer a picture of the car from our trip.The new Merc looking moody at StoerOne of our favourite places (of all the favourite places we have around this part of Scotland) is Clachtoll beach, which at the time we visited, was at high tide.Clachtoll beachGlencoeThe final day of our holiday was spent much further South, in Glencoe, stopping on the way down to make a brew and eat BLT sandwiches and cheese1 on the gravelly beach at Loch Lochy. Even with a wind, that was paradise.Loch LochyWe checked in to The Corran by the ferry terminal and headed straight out for a walk along the Coupall to catch some time with Buachaille Etive Mòr.Buachaille Etive MòrThis is a magical place, even in the rain. Actually, probably especially in the rain. The heather and harebells, dancing in the wind to the syncopation of the river rushing over the rocks, flail and flutter, the great herdsman above, indifferent to their earnest performance.Harebells at Etive MòrThe day’s adventure concluded with a flaccid fish supper from the Quarrier’s Kitchen in Ballachulish, before heading back to Corran to journal the day.HomeThe drive home was wet but not without adventure as we stopped at Tindrum, more to support the business than to buy stuff we actually needed. We marvelled at how busy it was, and how heavy the Northbound traffic was, caravans and campers heading in droves for the NC500 and the midges.We stopped briefly at Achnambeithatch, the little white cottage below Bidean nam Bian on the A82, to watch the weather for a while.AchnambeithatchWe decided that the rain was in for the day, so headed South, and lunched at the King’s House, as much to their delight as ours, emerging as they were for the first day back in business after months of COVID-19 closure.NotesI am a bit disappointed with the film photos on this trip. I hoped for better, sharper, images but am just not getting that with the big Fuji GW690ii at the moment.

      "content"  : "Kodak Professional Ektachrome E100 is a new, fine grained colour transparency film perfectly suited to bright spring sunshine and the countryside. In good light, I have always favoured Kodak transparency film for colour saturation, so this first time out for me with Kodak’s new T-grain modern slide film was a good exercise.Soaking up the sunshine at PattiesmuirThe April sun was splitting the sky, so we went out around Pattiesmuir, a local walking route which winds through rural pathways and copses, offering glimpses of the iconic Forth bridges and over rolling farmland.My wife and I have been going out with cameras for a number of years, both of us using Fuji X-series digital cameras usually. Recently, though, I have left the digital behind, and carried only a film camera. The more careful selections I am making is, I think, good for my photography because it slows me down and makes me think more carefully about framing, intent and especially the light. As a result, I do not take as many frames as I would with a digital camera in my hands. I find it hard to finish a roll of 36 in one go, and today was no exception.Norton CommonI next picked up the camera when, on another sunny day, we took ourselves on a bitter-sweet reflective walk on Norton Common. Earlier that day, we had said goodbye to my beloved Mum and it felt right to take ourselves to this special place in my old hometown. We found deer, and squirrels, sunbeams and forget-me-nots there, all of which seemed to be speaking to us in some way that was comforting.We had stayed in a little Air B&amp;B in the pretty village of Great Wymondley, the smaller of the two Wymondleys, not far from the A1. The country kitchen of the old stable block featured a table where we had sat in the sunrays and listened to the voices of the host’s children playing at the big house. There were poppies.RosythThe remaining half dozen frames were made on short exercise trips out the back door and into the park during the continuing COVID-19 restrictions.Blossom is so photogenic, and we are lucky to be living in a place where there is plenty to be found at this time of year.The cameraThe camera I used for this roll was an eBay-sourced Nikon FM of similar vintage to my old FM, whose shutter was sadly condemned last year. It feels very similar but different, not least because the focusing screen is quite mucky, which reminds me every time I frame a shot that this is a substitute for my real Nikon FM. It’s just not the same. I am loving the lens, however, which is the superb AI-s 28mm f/2.8 which gives excellent results across a range of apertures.Notes            #      Image      Aperture      Shutter      Comment                  3.

My wife and I went out during the so-called lockdown for some messages and a little exercise, having heard on the news that it’s OK to get in your car and take a short drive to somewhere local if it helps you remain socially distanced enough to fight the spread of COVID-19. We decided that a walk on a beach would be safer and more responsible than a walk in the local park.Stupid is as stupid doesI’m still not quite myself following a recent loss, but I make no excuses for myself: the first four exposures on this film in the camera were all carefully exposed without remembering to advance the film. I re-took the building (Charles Hill Battery) on frame 2 using the same settings.I double-exposed again on frame 4, re-taking the shots in 5 and 6. Apparently, photography is good for mindfulness. One of the scans, of the Monk’s Cave, where monks used to wait for the boat to take them to Inchcolm Island out in the Forth, I processed using the Nik Collection Silver Efex Pro 2 application to bring out the detail in the sky and foreground. I quite like it:ProcessingI like this film, known as TMY, because it’s reliably good and very tolerant of my handling. This roll I processed myself, using 50:1 Rodinal R09 for 18 minutes and Kodak Fixer/Hardener. I had the devil of a job getting the film on the Paterson Reel and got quite grumpy at myself. The development went OK once I’d sorted out my fingers and thumbs. I scanned a selection of the frames on my Epson using their dreadful Silverfast 8 software and noticed that pretty much every one had a band across the top, presumably from a light leak in the camera somewhere. You can see it in the building image above, and faintly in the tree image:I really don’t think I am going to worry about it - this camera cost me less than twenty quid including postage so a professional CLA1 is not economically viable. Quite probably the light seals along the bottom of the camera are just needing replaced, a job I might do in a future lock-down.The scanned tiff files were converted in Capture One, with a bit of contrast adjustment and cropping in the header image.Summary of the resultsI notice that I didn’t deviate from 1/200s shutter speed with this roll. It was quite bright and so perhaps 400 ISO wasn’t right for the conditions, given that this camera’s shutter doesn’t go any faster than that. Even inside the Monk’s cave (header image), I was exposing for the surfaces lit directly from the outside.NotesAll images on this page taken with an Agfa Isolette I fitted with the Agfa Agnar 1:4.5/85 lens.

      "content"  : "Ilford Delta is a well-known black and white film from the famous UK manufacturer that has been around for almost 30 years. I put a roll of 400 through a Nikon FM. This post describes some of the images I made and what I did with them. The film was exposed over the first few weeks of 2020 and sent to AG Photographic in Birmingham for developing.Harlow WaterWe had to take a trip to Essex in January and had time to take a walk along the River Stort that runs through a generic-looking town on the outskirts of London. The river seems clean enough to sustain life, as there were people fishing along the banks. The first image here is a crop: bottom right you can see fading from what looks like a light leak in the camera. I think it’s something to do with the back plate. I bought this camera from eBay to replace my original 1970s Nikon FM that has a condemned shutter, and the back doesn’t shut cleanly with the satisfying click of my original.Not sure I’d be eating any of the fish they caught, as there were dog walkers kicking their poochy-poo directly from where it was dropped on the tow path into the river. I asked one of the fishermen if this is normal behaviour round here. He said everybody did it. I was disappointed with that level of cultural disrespect amongst the dog-walking people of this town towards their environment. Despite being in the middle of an industrial estate, this little stretch of river, with its abandoned house-boats, is pretty, and no doubt home to a lot of life. It’s worth exploring - there’s more information here.The next image has been adjusted for tone in Capture One for a more vintage look. This might offend some “analogue” purists but I’m just playing here. There aren’t any rules, and Capture One is a nice tool for messing about with images that might otherwise be considered uninteresting.The Fife CoastWhen I next picked up the camera, we were up the East Neuk. I continued the split toning exercise with the next two frames, toning the shadows blue and the highlights in the complementary yellow.Here, the Forth River basks in sunrays from an approaching storm. The toning enhances, I think the menacing clouds and waters. For monochrome images, it might seem weird to re-introduce colour but I think as an artistic technique, it enhances these shore photos. It didn’t work for me with the Harlow Water images.Kinghorn BeachThe last of these photographs was taken a few days later, down on the beach at Kinghorn. It is untoned but suffers with the same light leak problem I talked about above. This image was taken in portrait orientation and cropped slightly to make use of the false flare. I think it looks OK.Summary of the resultsReviews of this film suggest that it is very sharp, although I am sure that this is true only when in better hands. I am not convinced that I get the best results by sending it to AG Photographic, although I don’t doubt they are the best of the labs out there. Perhaps this is just a manifestation of the Dunning-Kruger effect and I’ll change my mind once I learn more about it.When I took a roll of photographs back in the 1970’s and 1980’s, I would consider it a success if I got one or two good frames from a roll of 135. I think I have half a dozen here that I’m pleased with, despite the leaky light problem. A significant factor in this increased success rate must be the greater opportunity there is to work with the images post-processing. Even the scanning tool 1 allows me to straighten the horizon.Next stepsI will try this film again and process it myself to see if I get better results, but also maybe I ought to stop buying old cameras online and expecting them to perform optimally without at least letting someone who knows what they are doing check them over for me.Notes            Image      Camera      Lens      Film/ISO      Aperture      Shutter      Comment                  Header image      Nikon FM      Nikon 50mm f/1.8 Series E      Delta 400      f/16      1/125s      Earlsferry, Fife.

      "content"  : "In a recent post, I mentioned that I had bought a new-to-me Agfa Isolette I camera. In it, I discovered as I opened the back, was an old roll of Kodacolor II. I closed the back and rolled it on to the next frame. A couple of days later, when my wife and I went to the beach for some relief from the emerging COVID-19 situation, I took the camera along.Exposure heuristicsOn the beach, having not really thought about it properly, I decided to finish the film off. The Isolette doesn’t have a meter, and I’d forgotten my Gossen, so I figured I’d give the “Sunny 16” rule a try. This goes something like: “if it’s sunny, and you’re shooting at f/16, then the shutter speed is the inverse of the film speed.” I later discovered that this fim had a speed rating of 100 ASA, but at the time I guessed that it might be a 400, so went for a shutter speed of 1/200th of a second at f/22. This blunder might have been mitigated against by the well-known heuristic or rule-of-thumb for expired films stock, which suggests that you should treat the film as being slower by 1 stop for every decade it is out of date. So, I should have rated the original 100 ASA film at 25. If all of those estimates and rules were correct, I was effectively underexposing on the beach by about 4 stops. They weren’t.ResultsThe film was turned round by the brilliant AG Photolab in double-quick time, and I got to the scanner to have a look at these images. I wasn’t expecting stellar quality images and wasn’t disappointed. I pulled the scans into Capture One to see if I could do anything but in the end, I just cropped and exported them.The effect of age on film emulsionThe recent exposures at Kinghorn show quite a lot of fogging and what looks to me like a fungal film over the whole frame. There is evidence of light leaking into the frame at the top and bottom. I can’t explain this because the back of the camera hinges open - the central frames I inadvertently exposed when I opened the camera when I first unpacked it are as you’d expect. The red fog at the edges appears across the whole film. This is one of the frames exposed last week:History in the rollThe exposures from the beginning of the film were perhaps made when it was put into the back of the cupboard, or wherever, back in the 1980s when this little Isolette was last used before finding itself washed up on eBay. I have no idea where they were taken but the houses look familiar, as if in a garden city like Letchworth or Rosyth. The colours are endearing, unsurprisingly retro, perhaps.This was fun. I think I’ll try to clean up the camera a bit and try another roll.Notes            Image      Camera      Lens      Film/ISO      Aperture      Shutter      Comment                  Header image      Agfa Isolette I      Agfa Agnar 1:4.5/85      100      f/22      1/200s      Scan from the recent exposures.

This post tells me that this film was rated at 100 ASA and went out of production in 1983. I don’t expect very much from the three or four images I made with it, but it was fun trying out this old toy. The lens seems a little grubby but otherwise the camera seems to be clean and in good order for its age, and worth the £18 punted on it on eBay.See this post for how the images from this film turned out.Beach lifeThe sky over Edinburgh across the Forth was pretty dramatic, so we were excited to see a group of parasurfers setting up and enjoying the elements. There was a stiff breeze as the tide was coming in, so the waves were expressive and obviously not a small challenge for the boys and girls braving the wind chill.

Having worked together all morning to tidy the house, we finally sorted the camera gear and jumped in the car to head up the coast of Fife towards the East Neuk and the little town of Earlsferry.EarlsferryWe went to the shore at the Western edge of the town to exercise ourselves and our gear. Kara was keen to get some long exposures and I went looking for contrast as I had both the Fuji GW and Nikon FM loaded with black and white film. This is Bass Rock, taken with the Fuji:The same view, in Delta 400, taken with the Nikon FM and post-processed in Capture One Pro:The difference between the above two images goes beyond what you see, which is as much down to what I did with the image after it was developed as it is the difference in the two cameras. The Fuji is a medium format camera and produces negatives which are 6cm by 9cm in size: six times larger than those produced in the 35mm Nikon FM. This only really makes a difference if you want to make very large prints from the negatives, when the limitations of the photographer are as significant as anything else. This, I think, will torment me for the next few years as I develop and learn. What this big Fuji isn’t going to do, I am learning, is give me 350 mega-pixel images in super-sharp crispy detail, not at least until I learn how to manage and operate the equipment better.The Nikon made some more good images of the wonderful coastline here. I was using a Tiffen yellow filter to give contrast and texture in the sky at the same time as sustaining details in the shadows.St.Monans and AnstrutherSt Monans is famous for its zig-zag breakwater but is also where Kara’s family have deep fishing roots. We drove around the town and enjoyed a brilliant sky as the weather pushed and tugged at the air over the Forth Estuary, making rainshafts, cloud patterns, whooping, whacking waves on the rocks and double bows over the Eastern landscape. Food lust overcame us, so we headed for the world-famous Anstruther chippie and enjoyed proper fish and chips in the car as it got dark.Notes            Image      Camera      Lens      Film/ISO      Aperture      Shutter      Comment                  Header image      iPhone 11      1.54mm      20      f/2.4      1/200s      Rainbow over Earlsferry              Bass Rock through wall      Fuji GW690ii      90mm      Ilford Pan F Plus 50      f/22      1/15s                     Same view      Nikon FM      Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8      Delta 400      f/22      1/125s      Yellow filter.

Replenishing the hire car’s tank with about 20 litres of petrol cost about 200 Króna, the same as a single adult ticket to walk on the land nearby. We stopped at the huts in the place Kara had seen from that walk yesterday, and I ran off the final frames before packing the exposed rolls into a poly bag for easy security inspection at the airport.Check in made us feel like children again as a nice lady talked us through getting a luggage tag printed at the self-service machines, and loading our bags onto the automatic conveyor. Duty-free was actually cheap and I couldn’t resist buying a pack of Kvikk Lunsj. Interestingly, security did a visual check of the bag of film stock at my request (once the supervisor had OK’d it), so the only scan my rolls have had was at the grumpy airport at Edinburgh. I think I’m going to have to try to find out what the rules are on this - were the Faroese just being nice, reasonable people, or were the Scots just being bastards? I’d like to know but from a Kodak article I read yesterday the hand luggage scanners at airports are of too low a power to affect film stock significantly, even with multiple scans.LaterAt home, I packed the rolls off to AG Photo in Birmingham using their pre-paid mailer.

After breakfast, we headed out to find the lake above the sea. We did, but not before shelling out 200 Króna each for the privilege of access to the footways. A nicely spoken local girl was manning the barricade and promising tea and coffee when we returned from our hike.GasadalurOf course, she wasn’t there when we returned after sunset. We didn’t care much, having had around 10km and 120m of elevation to stretch our muscles on. Leitisvatn / Sørvágsvatn lake (“the lake above the sea”) pours over the Bøsdalafossur waterfall 30 metres into the sea below, which crashes dramatically against the cliff edges as if it were trying to get back up into the peaceful waters of the lake, where people were kayaking when we were there.Trælanípan (Slave Cliff)The cliffs on the walk to the lake are several hundred metres above the sea and even on a fairly calm day, as today was, the thought of a sudden gust or a seagull with a sense of humour kept us focused and not too close to the edge. We met a local near the top of the walk who chatted in good English about the Scottish fishermen who threw chocolate to the local kids, who in turn sold lighters to the fishermen. My wife’s grandfather was one of those fishermen.Yellow cottage near MiðvágurWe passed this little shed-cum-cottage several times as we explored the area around Miðvágur. I had to stop to capture this scene with the Fuji Pro film I was carrying. I love the colours and would love to come back to see it again in the summer light.Nix: the Faroese KelpieWe found this artsy sculpture near the roadside that runs by Lake Sørvágsvatn. It represents a Nykur, a mythical Scandinavian creature that drags children down to the bottom of the icy waters. Saying the name of the creature makes it lose all of its powers. I wonder if someone said the name of the sculptor.Notes            Image      Camera      Lens      Film      Aperture      Shutter      Comment                  Header image      Fuji GW690ii      90mm      Fuji Acros 100 II      f/32      1/4s      My wife, photographer Kara Mudie, at work at the Bøsdalafossur falls.

I will no doubt go home full of resolutions to do something about this, which will be dragged into the quicksand of daily hustle and bustle, leaving only the guilt as trace that I ever made them.SandavágurWe drove down to Sandavágur for the sunrise, which was wintery. Kara played with waves and the seals and I took a photo of the floodlit church which didn’t turn out the way I hoped. This is the church, taken the next day with Fuji Pro 400H.TrøllkonufingurWe drove to the Witch’s Finger (Trøllkonufingur) and walked along far enough to see the stack and promised to return to catch the sun rising here tomorrow.TórshavnAfter a good breakfast we headed for the Streymoy tunnel and Tórshavn, where we ate extremely expensive sushi. One of the delights of the Faroes is that they have not learned how to do tourism yet, with its expected levels of service. Certainly our waitress hadn’t done the course. I’m not complaining - it’s nice to have the feeling that you’re not just following in the footsteps of 80 million people before you, taking the same photos.

Aurora Watch says we ought to be able to see some action but the 8 okta cloud cover says otherwise. Coffee, fruit and biscuits to wake us up instead. Once the daylight appeared we got to see and appreciate the view from the house.Not Scotland, not Thailand, but with some characteristics of both. I loaded the Fuji with Kodak TMY 400 ISO film and fitted a deep yellow Tiffen filter. Why that one? It’s the one I have. Why a filter? We’re going to be focusing on landscapes and I want to try not to wreck the skies: the yellow will darken the bluer highlights in the sky and reveal the cloud texture. You can see how this turned out in the header image on the previous page, which was taken later that morning.BøurThe delightful little village at Bøur has some great views, including the Draganir Sea Stacks, an iconic feature of the Faroes. All around the islands and in these communities are signs reminding visitors of the importance of respect for the environment, the creatures that live here and the people. One of the striking features of this place is the black sand beach (see header image, taken with Kodak Portra 160).Digital backupI finished that roll of TMY at Bøur on the beach, and backed up the captures using the Ricoh GRIII I carry everywhere, and my Fuji X-T2 fitted with the brilliant Fuji 16mm f/1.4 prime lens. I wondered whether the sun was too low in the sky for the Portra film (Miami, this ain’t) but the film worked out really nicely, in my view (see header image). The best image of the day has been a 3-photo stitch of the village Gasadalur from the bench at a hairpin bend in the road looking west towards the helipad that was the only outside communication link for the community before the road was built.Later - re-scanningI re-scanned a couple of these images to see if the output quality was any better. It is, depending on how you measure it. This is a (reduced version of the scanner output) 350 Mega-pixel file, scanned from  6x9cm negative at 6400 dpi:Island (Re-scan)If you compare the quality of image I got with the Fuji X-T2 (Gasadalur, above), there really is no argument for film photography, based upon these results. Now, I know that medium format cameras capture a lot of information, but that depends on a lot of things being exactly right. Get more than a couple of parameters sub-optimal and you’re wasting your time striving for that Nirvana of image-making.Notes            Image      Camera      Lens      Film/ISO      Aperture      Shutter      Comment                  Header image      Fuji GW690ii      90mm      Kodak Portra 160      f/22      1/30s      The black sands at Bøur beach              Miðvágur      Ricoh GRIII      18.3mm      ISO 1250      f/16      1/30s                     Draganir Sea Stacks      Fuji GW690ii      90mm      Kodak TMY 400      f/22      1/30s      (cropped)              Gasadalur      Fuji X-T2      XF16mm F1.4 R WR      400      f/11      1/60s      3-image stitch pano.

I’m delighted about that, of course. More on that story here.Travelling by plane with filmWe are on board a flight from Edinburgh to Vágar, the capital of the Faroe Islands. I have my Fuji GW690ii medium format camera with me and a stock of 9 film rolls that hopefully haven’t been ruined by the airport security scan at Edinburgh. Despite my protests, the security people scanned all of the unexposed film. We’ll see if there is any effect on the stock1. I think the greatest danger to the film still lies in my photographic skills.Notes            Image      Camera      Lens      Film      Aperture      Shutter      Comment                  Header image      Fuji GW690ii      90mm      Kodak T-Max 400      f/32      1/60s      Sandavágur, yellow filter              Airbus      iPhone 11      4.25mm      ISO 125      f/1.8      1/84s      Cropped, colour shifted warmer in Preview              Films      iPhone 11      4.25mm      ISO 100      f/1.8      1/100s      Cropped                  There hasn’t been, as far as I can tell. None of the film rolls were over ISO 400, and the airport scanners nowadays seem to be quite low energy, although there is some concern, especially with the increase in the use of CT scanners at airports, mainly in the US. See this post from Petapixel, for example, which reports on advice from Kodak that there is evidence of significant damage to film every time it is scanned. Caveat emptor, and tie up your camel. &#8617;      "

      "content"  : "The Royal Photographic Society has recommended a panel of my photographs for the distinction of Licentiate (LRPS). This, some 8 months after my wife and I first submitted, with one of us being awarded LRPS immediately.The LRPS PanelI had to make changes to one of my images (09 Fenchurch Street) to remove distracting lines that were at first taken to be a printing error. You can see all of the images in the panel over on Flickr.Panel LayoutSometimes called the eleventh image, the layout of the panel of photographs is an important aspect for the assessors. There has to be a pleasing aesthetic to the arrangement and balance of the images when displayed as a complete body. I spent far too long worrying about details of aspect ratio and colour balance across the panel, I think. The advisory day was useful to get a sense of what the assessors like. These are things like the two faces looking inwards, similar colours at each end of a row, those kinds of spectrumy details that provide satisfaction for a critical viewer, and they are, critical.Next stepsI am pleased to have finally achieved this distinction which I take to be an acknowledgement that I am learning something about photography. I’d like to continue my artistic journey by developing my knowledge and skills of the photographic process. I have continued this through making the improvements required to the panel first submitted, and by exploring composition using medium format film, for example.Notes            Image      Camera      Lens      Film/ISO      Aperture      Shutter      Comment                  Header image      Fuji X-T2      16mm      200      f/11      -      03 Julian Alps, one of the images in my LRPS Panel.              09 Fenchurch Street      Fuji X-E2      Fujifilm Fujinon XF27mm F2.8      400      f/8      1/450s      The image not up to standard first time, with the lines visible.

I wanted to try to make a space where I can, if I can find the time, tell the stories of the images. Or maybe post the images of the stories. Whatever.

It's really just my reference. Not all of these were scanned, and most of them aren't on this site. Ask if you're particularly interested.I got out of the habit of pedantically recording every frame setting after about a year of doing it. Once I'd let go of that habit, I lost the opportunity to efficiently learn all of the variables and their influence on the outcome of a capture but hugely improved the enjoyment of photography. It became less neurotic: more art than science: although the science is still there, it's more in the moment. I beleive that the process of photography becomes more significant and the reward for me is not so much in the outcomes, although these are sometimes pleasing, as in the creative process itself.

I sent them all to be processed by AG Labs.CostsTotal film stock cost £83.00, plus processing costs £38.80 (£3.49 C-41, £3.99 BW, £4.89 pp, AG Photolabs). Total costs £121.80 for 70 frames (2 were spoilt - lens cap on), or about £1.74 per frame on average. Breakdown by film:            Qty.

In retrospect, this is probably not the best situation to use this legendary contrasty film. The results were not stunning, in my view, and certainly not as good as I expected, but that’s operator error and not a problem with the film stock. Notice the first few exposures are all long, but get less long as the Northern winter light improved.            Frame      Image      Aperture      Shutter      Comment                  1.

I’m not giving up on it, because I’ve seen good results elsewhere but I’m not sufficiently expert to get the most out of orthographic film yet. This point is emphasised by the fact that I left the lens cap on for frames 2 and 3. My notes suggest I had an ND filter on for these pictures. That possibly didn’t help much either.

About 54p per image.Problems with light flares on most of the 36 exposures. AG were very helpful and suggested these were light leaks in the camera - I’m going to put it in for a proper clean, lube, adjust and to have the light seals replaced. The Fuji GW690ii also, and probably my old Nikon FM body. The best camera I have at the moment (film) is the fifteen-quid Afga. That leaks too, sometimes, but it often takes excellent photos.I also think that when everything works (i.e. the camera, the operator), this film stock works really well, even if at the moment most of what I am taking is pretty dull stuff.Clematis            Brand      Type      ISO      Format      Exposures      Camera      Lens                  Kodak      Portra      800      35mm      36      Nikon FM      Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8                  Frame      Image      Aperture      Shutter      Comment                  1.

Stand development means no agitation: solutions must therefore be gently poured into the Paterson tank, to avoid bubbles of air being trapped between the film surfaces. This process is called semi-stand because of the turn half-way through. I followed the recipe kindly posted by Gerald Greenwood. That post is well worth a read and made me laugh out loud. Gerald seems to be a man after my own heart: bored with manly men acting like boys comparing toys, and just wanting good, consistent results.

Used without a filter, which was a stupid mistake. I eventually got the film developed at AG photographic as things got busy and I just couldn’t find time to develop this (and other) films myself.All of the frames in this roll were affected by light leaks but also showed up really bright skies at Clachtoll. This is maybe not surprising, given that the film is orthochromatic and insensitive to red: I probably went with the meter reading in the camera which isn’t, and so over exposed the sky. I should have used a filter. I think I also shot too wide and ended up with poor depth of the field for some of the compositions.
