    "text": "Sunday 4th October, 2020.\n\nI took my little Agfa Isolette, loaded with Kodak Ektachrome E100 to nearby Kinghorn beach, a place my wife and I often go to for a bit of headspace and diversion from the rest of the world.\n\n\nDespite the habits of the digital age, for this roll, I didn’t record all the exposure details, going broadly with “sunny 16”, occasionally referring to an app on my iPhone for aperture and shutter speed combinations that might be reasonable. It was a bright, partly sunny day, and I took some of the shots at 1/50 s hand-held, although some were at 1/200 s or between these two. Apertures were between f/8 and f/16, mostly. I finished the film and sent it to AG for developing with another E100 I had recently finished in my Fuji GW690ii.\n\n\n\nThe transparencies were scanned in an Epson V600. At 6400 dpi, this yields a file around 750 MB in size, and an image approaching 250 megapixels, but this is not anything like equivalent to “better than a Fuji GFX” unless the camera and photographer have combined to capture the absolute highest quality image possible. I certainly am not consistently getting that kind of precision, even if the camera can, but it won’t stop me trying. I scanned these at 3200 dpi for an image nearer 50 Megapixels in a file under 200MB after cropping.\n Near Kinghorn beach. Adjusted for crop and wonky horizons in Iridient Developer. Size reduction for the web was in Apple’s Preview.\n Inchkeith Island. Cropped and adjusted in Iridient Developer.\nIt’s not lost on me that a roll of this film, with processing, costs more than the camera did. I’m sure that’s not a unique situation but given that the Agfa Isolette is a medium format camera, and the quality of the capture and rendering are, in my view, pretty good, then I am left wondering why I am also happy, from time to time, to launch a grand or more on a digital camera. Maybe those days are over.\nThe variation in exposures in this roll are certainly operator error. I do a lot of calculating while I shoot, having never developed any real “intuitive feel” for exposure over the years. There’s time yet – as Henri Cartier-Bresson says, “your first 10,000 photographs are your worst”.\n\n\n\nColour positive (slide) film, cost £12.40 per roll from Analog Wonderland.

    "title": "First experiences with Ilford Delta 400 35mm film.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Earlsferry, Fife.\nIlford Delta is a well-known black and white film from the famous UK manufacturer that has been around for almost 30 years. I put a roll of 400 through a Nikon FM. This post describes some of the images I made and what I did with them. The film was exposed over the first few weeks of 2020 and sent to AG Photographic in Birmingham for developing.\n\n\nWe had to take a trip to Essex in January and had time to take a walk along the River Stort that runs through a generic-looking town on the outskirts of London. The river seems clean enough to sustain life, as there were people fishing along the banks. The first image here is a crop: bottom right you can see fading from what looks like a light leak in the camera. I think it’s something to do with the back plate. I bought this camera from eBay to replace my original 1970s Nikon FM that has a condemned shutter, and the back doesn’t shut cleanly with the satisfying click of my original.\n Harlow Water\nNot sure I’d be eating any of the fish they caught, as there were dog walkers kicking their poochy-poo directly from where it was dropped on the tow path into the river. I asked one of the fishermen if this is normal behaviour round here. He said everybody did it. I was disappointed with that level of cultural disrespect amongst the dog-walking people of this town towards their environment. Despite being in the middle of an industrial estate, this little stretch of river, with its abandoned house-boats, is pretty, and no doubt home to a lot of life. It’s worth exploring - there’s more information here.\n Harlow Water\nThe next image has been adjusted for tone in Capture One for a more vintage look. This might offend some “analogue” purists but I’m just playing here. There aren’t any rules, and Capture One is a nice tool for messing about with images that might otherwise be considered uninteresting.\n Harlow Mill\n\n\n\nWhen I next picked up the camera, we were up the East Neuk. I continued the split toning exercise with the next two frames, toning the shadows blue and the highlights in the complementary yellow.\n Bass Rock\nHere, the Forth River basks in sunrays from an approaching storm. The toning enhances, I think the menacing clouds and waters. For monochrome images, it might seem weird to re-introduce colour but I think as an artistic technique, it enhances these shore photos. It didn’t work for me with the Harlow Water images.\n Forth River\n\n\n\nThe last of these photographs was taken a few days later, down on the beach at Kinghorn. It is untoned but suffers with the same light leak problem I talked about above. This image was taken in portrait orientation and cropped slightly to make use of the false flare. I think it looks OK.\n Kinghorn\n\n\n\nReviews of this film suggest that it is very sharp, although I am sure that this is true only when in better hands. I am not convinced that I get the best results by sending it to AG Photographic, although I don’t doubt they are the best of the labs out there. Perhaps this is just a manifestation of the Dunning-Kruger effect and I’ll change my mind once I learn more about it.\nWhen I took a roll of photographs back in the 1970’s and 1980’s, I would consider it a success if I got one or two good frames from a roll of 135. I think I have half a dozen here that I’m pleased with, despite the leaky light problem. A significant factor in this increased success rate must be the greater opportunity there is to work with the images post-processing.

The river seems clean enough to sustain life, as there were people fishing along the banks. The first image here is a crop: bottom right you can see fading from what looks like a light leak in the camera. I think it’s something to do with the back plate. I bought this camera from eBay to replace my original 1970s Nikon FM that has a condemned shutter, and the back doesn’t shut cleanly with the satisfying click of my original.\n Harlow Water\nNot sure I’d be eating any of the fish they caught, as there were dog walkers kicking their poochy-poo directly from where it was dropped on the tow path into the river. I asked one of the fishermen if this is normal behaviour round here. He said everybody did it. I was disappointed with that level of cultural disrespect amongst the dog-walking people of this town towards their environment. Despite being in the middle of an industrial estate, this little stretch of river, with its abandoned house-boats, is pretty, and no doubt home to a lot of life. It’s worth exploring - there’s more information here.\n Harlow Water\nThe next image has been adjusted for tone in Capture One for a more vintage look. This might offend some “analogue” purists but I’m just playing here. There aren’t any rules, and Capture One is a nice tool for messing about with images that might otherwise be considered uninteresting.\n Harlow Mill"

I am not convinced that I get the best results by sending it to AG Photographic, although I don’t doubt they are the best of the labs out there. Perhaps this is just a manifestation of the Dunning-Kruger effect and I’ll change my mind once I learn more about it.\nWhen I took a roll of photographs back in the 1970’s and 1980’s, I would consider it a success if I got one or two good frames from a roll of 135. I think I have half a dozen here that I’m pleased with, despite the leaky light problem. A significant factor in this increased success rate must be the greater opportunity there is to work with the images post-processing. Even the scanning tool 1 allows me to straighten the horizon."

    "text": "I exposed several rolls of 120 film in my Fuji GW690 “Texas Leica” during a trip to the Faroe Islands in February 2020. The camera has a fixed 90mm f/3.5 lens and takes 6 cm x 9 cm frames, or 8 per roll of 120. I sent them all to be processed by AG Labs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, the good news came by email around 12:40 from Simon Vercoe, the LRPS admin assistant at the Royal Photographic Society, that I am finally to be awarded the distinction of “Licentiate” of the RPS. I’m delighted about that, of course. More on that story here.\n\n\n\nWe are on board a flight from Edinburgh to Vágar, the capital of the Faroe Islands. I have my Fuji GW690ii medium format camera with me and a stock of 9 film rolls that hopefully haven’t been ruined by the airport security scan at Edinburgh. Despite my protests, the security people scanned all of the unexposed film. We’ll see if there is any effect on the stock1.

The first film I loaded into the camera was one of the rolls of Kodak TMY, aka T-Max 400 and fitted a deep yellow Tiffen filter. Why that one? It’s the one I have. Why a filter? We’re going to be focusing on landscapes and I want to try not to wreck the skies: the yellow will darken the bluer highlights in the sky and reveal the cloud texture. You can see how this turned out in the above image which was taken later that morning. As it turned out, this was the only roll of this film stock that saw the light of day on this trip2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrame\nImage\nAperture\nShutter\nComment\n\n\n\n\n1.\nMorning, East over the village\nf/22\n1/4s\nYellow filter\n\n\n2.\nRiver\nf/32\n1/2s\nPortrait\n\n\n3.\nSandavágur\nf/32\n1/60s\n\n\n\n4.\nSea stacks\nf/22\n1/30s\nFrom Bøur\n\n\n5. & 6.\nSea stacks\nf/22\n1/45s\n\n\n\n7.\nBeach\nf/32\n1/60s\n\n\n\n8.\nBeach\nf/32\n1/30s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA good sleep. waking early to a still, deep darkness.

All around the islands and in these communities are signs reminding visitors of the importance of respect for the environment, the creatures that live here and the people. One of the striking features of this place is the black sand beach.\n The black sands at Bøur beach Portra\nMy first efforts with Portra. I think we might have been too far North for this film, which seems to be more at home nearer the Equator. I exposed this film during the rest of day 2 and the following morning.

I wondered whether the sun was too low in the sky for the Portra film (Miami, this ain’t) but the film worked out really nicely, in my view.\n Gasadalur\nThe best image of the day has been a 3-photo stitch of the village Gasadalur from the bench at a hairpin bend in the road looking west towards the helipad that was the only outside communication link for the community before the road was built. This is a 3-image stitch panorama taken with a Fuji X-T2, using the XF16mm F1.4 R WR lens. ISO 400, f/11, 1/60s.\n\n\n\nI re-scanned a couple of these images to see if the output quality was any better. It is, depending on how you measure it. This is a (reduced version of the scanner output) 350 Mega-pixel file, scanned from 6x9cm negative at 6400 dpi:\n Island (Re-scan of frame 5, Portra)\nIf you compare the quality of image I got with the Fuji X-T2 (Gasadalur, above), there really is no argument for film photography, based upon these results. Now, I know that medium format cameras capture a lot of information, but that depends on a lot of things being exactly right. Get more than a couple of parameters sub-optimal and you’re wasting your time striving for that Nirvana of image-making. To me, the important difference is how it feels.\n\n\n\n\n\n Seal at Sandavágur (cropped) Fuji X-T2, XF90mm F2 R LM WR, ISO 800, f/2 1/500s\n\n\nStudying the local guide map over coffee and a biscuit, I realise how ignorant I feel about the place and culture I am in. This, as a consequence of the pace of life I am leading, ironically to pay for the privilege of travel. I will no doubt go home full of resolutions to do something about this, which will be dragged into the quicksand of daily hustle and bustle, leaving only the guilt as trace that I ever made them.\n\n\n\nWe drove down to Sandavágur for the sunrise, which was wintery. Kara played with waves and the seals and I took a photo of the floodlit church which didn’t turn out the way I hoped. This is the church, taken the next day with Fuji Pro 400H.\n Sandavágur Church Fuji Pro 400H, second roll, frame 2\n\n\n\nWe drove to the Witch’s Finger (Trøllkonufingur) and walked along far enough to see the stack and promised to return to catch the sun rising here tomorrow.\n Trøllkonufingur Fuji Pro 400H, post processed in Iridient\n\n\n\nAfter a good breakfast we headed for the Streymoy tunnel and Tórshavn, where we ate extremely expensive sushi. One of the delights of the Faroes is that they have not learned how to do tourism yet, with its expected levels of service. Certainly our waitress hadn’t done the course. I’m not complaining - it’s nice to have the feeling that you’re not just following in the footsteps of 80 million people before you, taking the same photos. I didn’t take many photos in the town: it’s nice, and there is a harbour and some old buildings but it was raining and I was happy just experiencing the place.\n\n\n\nI used 2 rolls of Fuji Pro 400H in different contexts: starting with the Trøllkonufingur, the town of Tórshavn, and at Gasadalur, the iconic lake over the sea.\n\n\n\nFrame\nImage\nAperture\nShutter\nComment\n\n\n\n\n1.\nTrøllkonufingur\nf/22\n1/125s\nThe “witchs fingers”.

Acros\n\n\nWe went out for sunrise at the Witch’s Finger (Trøllkonufingur) which was unspectacular due to clouds obstructing the sun but still fun. After breakfast, we headed out to find the lake above the sea. We did, but not before shelling out 200 Króna each for the privilege of access to the footways. A nicely spoken local girl was manning the barricade and promising tea and coffee when we returned from our hike.\n Bøsdalafossur Fuji X-T2 XF16mm ISO 200 f/16 1/50s, some post processing in Capture One Pro 20\nOf course, she wasn’t there when we returned after sunset. We didn’t care much, having had around 10km and 120m of elevation to stretch our muscles on. Leitisvatn / Sørvágsvatn lake (“the lake above the sea”) pours over the Bøsdalafossur waterfall 30 metres into the sea below, which crashes dramatically against the cliff edges as if it were trying to get back up into the peaceful waters of the lake, where people were kayaking when we were there.\n\n\n\n Trælanípan Ricoh GRIII ISO 200 f/5 1/400s, some post processing in Capture One Pro 20\nThe cliffs on the walk to the lake are several hundred metres above the sea and even on a fairly calm day, as today was, the thought of a sudden gust or a seagull with a sense of humour kept us focused and not too close to the edge. We met a local near the top of the walk who chatted in good English about the Scottish fishermen who threw chocolate to the local kids, who in turn sold lighters to the fishermen. My wife’s grandfather was one of those fishermen.\n\n\n\n Yellow cottage near Miðvágur Fuji Pro 400H\nWe passed this little shed-cum-cottage several times as we explored the area around Miðvágur. I had to stop to capture this scene with the Fuji Pro film I was carrying. I love the colours and would love to come back to see it again in the summer light.\n\n\n\n Nix X-T2 XF16mm ISO 400 f/2.8 1/500s pp and cropped in Capture One Pro 20\nWe found this artsy sculpture near the roadside that runs by Lake Sørvágsvatn. It represents a Nykur, a mythical Scandinavian creature that drags children down to the bottom of the icy waters. Saying the name of the creature makes it lose all of its powers. I wonder if someone said the name of the sculptor.\n\n\n\nFirst time out with Acros was in the early morning as the sun came up over the Trøllkonufingur.

I’m delighted about that, of course. More on that story here.\n\n\n\nWe are on board a flight from Edinburgh to Vágar, the capital of the Faroe Islands. I have my Fuji GW690ii medium format camera with me and a stock of 9 film rolls that hopefully haven’t been ruined by the airport security scan at Edinburgh. Despite my protests, the security people scanned all of the unexposed film. We’ll see if there is any effect on the stock1.

We’re going to be focusing on landscapes and I want to try not to wreck the skies: the yellow will darken the bluer highlights in the sky and reveal the cloud texture.

All around the islands and in these communities are signs reminding visitors of the importance of respect for the environment, the creatures that live here and the people. One of the striking features of this place is the black sand beach.\n The black sands at Bøur beach Portra\nMy first efforts with Portra. I think we might have been too far North for this film, which seems to be more at home nearer the Equator. I exposed this film during the rest of day 2 and the following morning.

I wondered whether the sun was too low in the sky for the Portra film (Miami, this ain’t) but the film worked out really nicely, in my view.\n Gasadalur\nThe best image of the day has been a 3-photo stitch of the village Gasadalur from the bench at a hairpin bend in the road looking west towards the helipad that was the only outside communication link for the community before the road was built. This is a 3-image stitch panorama taken with a Fuji X-T2, using the XF16mm F1.4 R WR lens. ISO 400, f/11, 1/60s.\n\n\n\nI re-scanned a couple of these images to see if the output quality was any better. It is, depending on how you measure it. This is a (reduced version of the scanner output) 350 Mega-pixel file, scanned from 6x9cm negative at 6400 dpi:\n Island (Re-scan of frame 5, Portra)\nIf you compare the quality of image I got with the Fuji X-T2 (Gasadalur, above), there really is no argument for film photography, based upon these results. Now, I know that medium format cameras capture a lot of information, but that depends on a lot of things being exactly right. Get more than a couple of parameters sub-optimal and you’re wasting your time striving for that Nirvana of image-making. To me, the important difference is how it feels."

This, as a consequence of the pace of life I am leading, ironically to pay for the privilege of travel. I will no doubt go home full of resolutions to do something about this, which will be dragged into the quicksand of daily hustle and bustle, leaving only the guilt as trace that I ever made them.\n\n\n\nWe drove down to Sandavágur for the sunrise, which was wintery.

I’m not complaining - it’s nice to have the feeling that you’re not just following in the footsteps of 80 million people before you, taking the same photos.

After breakfast, we headed out to find the lake above the sea. We did, but not before shelling out 200 Króna each for the privilege of access to the footways.

We didn’t care much, having had around 10km and 120m of elevation to stretch our muscles on. Leitisvatn / Sørvágsvatn lake (“the lake above the sea”) pours over the Bøsdalafossur waterfall 30 metres into the sea below, which crashes dramatically against the cliff edges as if it were trying to get back up into the peaceful waters of the lake, where people were kayaking when we were there.\n\n\n\n Trælanípan Ricoh GRIII ISO 200 f/5 1/400s, some post processing in Capture One Pro 20\nThe cliffs on the walk to the lake are several hundred metres above the sea and even on a fairly calm day, as today was, the thought of a sudden gust or a seagull with a sense of humour kept us focused and not too close to the edge. We met a local near the top of the walk who chatted in good English about the Scottish fishermen who threw chocolate to the local kids, who in turn sold lighters to the fishermen. My wife’s grandfather was one of those fishermen.\n\n\n\n Yellow cottage near Miðvágur Fuji Pro 400H\nWe passed this little shed-cum-cottage several times as we explored the area around Miðvágur.

    "text": "The final frames\nI lost my mum in March this year, just as COVID was descending on the world. As long as I remember, she had always been keen, sometimes too keen, to capture a moment in a photograph. I inherited a rich and wonderful collection of albums and shoe-boxes full of family memories, and of quite a lot of people I don’t recognise.\nAmongst her possessions was a little point-and-shoot automatic 35mm camera, a Premier PC-645D. It still had a film in it. I took the camera with me on a couple of trips, including our anniversary weekend to Dunkeld, where we had been married the year before. In some sense, it was a way of making up for her not being able to travel up to Scotland for our wedding: we had taken her the albums of the wedding to see before she was admitted to hospital on Christmas Eve 2019. For a short while this year, it was as if she was with us.\nHer final pictures were typical. This one, evidence of a mystery. A bungee strap had suddenly appeared with a clatter on the roof of her cottage one day, on the day a stowaway’s body was found in a Clapham garden. Mum was convinced that this strap had something to do with it and alerted the authorities, who took no interest. I told her that I thought it entirely feasible that the strap might be connected to the tragedy somehow.\n Bungee from the sky\nThe second is of three visitors to her little house in Letchworth, Michelle, Marilyn and Tracey, cousins on the Brennan side (my grandmother’s). Mum often had visitors; Michelle wrote of this visit:\n\nI lost her phone number and we just went unannounced, but she still made us welcome. I’m so grateful we decided to go anyway as this was to be the last time we saw her. Letchworth captured my heart, and from the first time I went with my mum to re-unite with the cousins Audreys, I absolutely adored your mum, such a beautiful and fascinating lady. I will never forget all her advice, she taught me so much that I didn’t know about our family on the Brennan side, especially the ones that emigrated to Canada.\n\n Three visitors\nWe took a trip along the coast near us, to Crail. Here’s my wife at work, and the kind of place mum would have enjoyed being if she were able to travel. Her health wasn’t the best, it never had been, but she never offered it as an excuse or let it prevent her from living the most fruitful and interesting life. The crashing waves on this rocky coast would have been right up her street.\n Crail\nFinally, on the weekend to Dunkeld, I took a selfie for mum of my wife and I in the mirror in our suite, not taking into account the flash on this little point-and-shoot, “focus free” camera. I can’t help thinking that the flare somehow indicates her presence with us on that day as we celebrated our anniversary, and remembered a remarkable woman.\n Is that you?"

    "text": "03 Julian Alps, one of the images in my LRPS Panel. Fuji X-T2 16mm ISO 200 f/11\nThe Royal Photographic Society has recommended a panel of my photographs for the distinction of Licentiate (LRPS). This, some 8 months after my wife and I first submitted, with one of us being awarded LRPS immediately.\n\n\nI had to make changes to one of my images (09 Fenchurch Street) to remove distracting lines that were at first taken to be a printing error.\n\n\n\nSometimes called the eleventh image, the layout of the panel of photographs is an important aspect for the assessors. There has to be a pleasing aesthetic to the arrangement and balance of the images when displayed as a complete body. I spent far too long worrying about details of aspect ratio and colour balance across the panel, I think. The advisory day was useful to get a sense of what the assessors like. These are things like the two faces looking inwards, similar colours at each end of a row, those kinds of spectrumy details that provide satisfaction for a critical viewer, and they are, critical.\n\n\n\nI am pleased to have finally achieved this distinction which I take to be an acknowledgement that I am learning something about photography. I’d like to continue my artistic journey by developing my knowledge and skills of the photographic process. I have continued this through making the improvements required to the panel first submitted, and by exploring composition using medium format film, for example.\n\n\n\nRPS Logo"

    "text": "Being in the sunshine with Kodak Ektachrome E100  Frame 28. Young tree shoots\nKodak Professional Ektachrome E100 is a new, fine grained colour transparency film perfectly suited to bright spring sunshine and the countryside. In good light, I have always favoured Kodak transparency film for colour saturation, so this first time out for me with Kodak’s new T-grain modern slide film was a good exercise.\n\n\nThe April sun was splitting the sky, so we went out around Pattiesmuir, a local walking route which winds through rural pathways and copses, offering glimpses of the iconic Forth bridges and over rolling farmland.\n Frame 3. Pattiesmuir\nMy wife and I have been going out with cameras for a number of years, both of us using Fuji X-series digital cameras usually. Recently, though, I have left the digital behind, and carried only a film camera. The more careful selections I am making is, I think, good for my photography because it slows me down and makes me think more carefully about framing, intent and especially the light. As a result, I do not take as many frames as I would with a digital camera in my hands. I find it hard to finish a roll of 36 in one go, and today was no exception.\n\n\n\nI next picked up the camera when, on another sunny day, we took ourselves on a bitter-sweet reflective walk on Norton Common. Earlier that day, we had said goodbye to my beloved Mum and it felt right to take ourselves to this special place in my old hometown. We found deer, and squirrels, sunbeams and forget-me-nots there, all of which seemed to be speaking to us in some way that was comforting.\n Frame 24. Forget-me-nots\nWe had stayed in a little Air B&B in the pretty village of Great Wymondley, the smaller of the two Wymondleys, not far from the A1. The country kitchen of the old stable block featured a table where we had sat in the sunrays and listened to the voices of the host’s children playing at the big house. There were poppies.\n Frame 30 Poppies\n\n\n\nThe remaining half dozen frames were made on short exercise trips out the back door and into the park during the continuing COVID-19 restrictions.\n Frame 35 Blossom\nBlossom is so photogenic, and we are lucky to be living in a place where there is plenty to be found at this time of year.\n\n\n\nThe camera I used for this roll was an eBay-sourced Nikon FM of similar vintage to my old FM, whose shutter was sadly condemned last year. It feels very similar but different, not least because the focusing screen is quite mucky, which reminds me every time I frame a shot that this is a substitute for my real Nikon FM. It’s just not the same. I am loving the lens, however, which is the superb AI-s 28mm f/2.8 which gives excellent results across a range of apertures.\n\n\n\nColour positive (slide) film, cost £14 per roll from Analog Wonderland.

    "text": "December, 2020. After Christmas. Some thoughts at the end of an interesting year.\n Glenquey reservoir\nLike many people, I don’t see the point of making resolutions at the end of the year, only to break them within a few days of returning to normal life, its pressures and temptations. This year, the (first?) year of pandemic restrictions, has given us all opportunities to reflect a little: the reflection necessarily includes looking at oneself. Here is where we see ourselves more objectively – in the moments of noticing just how we change as we get older. Perhaps also, we observe how we have not changed when we ought to have.\n\n\n Glendevon\nWell, there’s been COVID, of course, but there have been other things going on. We lost my Mum in March, after a 3-month circus tour of various hospitals and the lottery of the NHS that began on Christmas Eve 2019. Others left us too, and there is sadness more than usual this Christmas as we remember them. Without diminishing our losses, there has also been much joy: weddings, our own first anniversary which was spent in favourite places around Dunkeld; and the last instalments of our honeymoon with friends in the North, and then even further North in the Faroes.\n\n\n\n This image of a bridge at Glendevon1 suggests that as we cross into the New Year, the road may be slippery at times. We probably need to lose a bit of weight (I feel like I am 7ft 6in wide in places), and we certainly ought to slow down a bit. Working life, not to be ungrateful for my exciting and challenging job2, has been more challenge than excitement in 2020. I have COVID back from Zooming too much from the couch, suffered nightmares from stress anxiety and have more than once drafted a desperate resignation letter. The Christmas break has reminded me of the blessings proper sleep brings. I resolve to sleep better.\nBeyond the bridge, we are advised that we must not park in passing places, so as to not be a nuisance to others and obstruct their passage. This year, I have noticed even more that I have not been quite who I was before becoming an educator: ever since that career move in 2003, I have had an insidious, creeping feeling that I don’t belong, that I am somehow in the way. I resolve to assert with confidence and authority, as I spent so long learning, my confidence and authority. May I not overdo that resolution. Or, may I do it so well I have to return to a more lucrative profession.\nOr, maybe something else entirely. Not photography, perhaps, there’s no money in that3.\n\n\n\nThe last sign to heed in our bridge image is “Danger of death”. Susan Sontag said, “All photographs are memento mori” and she is right, even outwith the context she said that in. Photography reminds us that time passes and we all tread steadfastly towards our own demise with each snap of the shutter. This is reason to be cheerful, isn’t it? Death is inevitable, so there’s no point in being sad about it. I am expecting something to fall off a shelf as I type that4.\nI’ve been (re-)learning how to take photographs on film, and now feel confident enough to invest in my first Hasselblad, which will be here in a week or so. Clearly, I resolve to take many images with that, and to not neglect the other cameras I am privileged enough to own. Film photography, it is often said, requires a slower, more thoughtful approach than the spray-and-pray approach of digital. I can’t disagree, and I have loved the more considered captures I have taken on 35mm and medium format film this year. My best images are often digital, though, so I am not going to try not to favour one format over the other.\n Fujica Pro 400H, taken on a Fuji X-T2 camera but with a Nikon 50mm E-series lens, reverse mounted on an adaptor. A proper example of analogue meets digital photography. Notice, however, the square format, presaging the arrival of more 6x6 images.\n\n\n\nDo your worst. No, wait. Don’t do that. Do what you have to, to enjoy each day as if it’s your last. To fill it with joie-de-vivre. To make music. To create. To love, and if possible, to be loved. Everything else is irrelevant.\n\n\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the images on this page were taken with a Fuji X-T2 camera fitted with a Fujinon XF100-400mm F4.5-5.6 R LM OIS WR lens.\n\n\n\nImage\nFocal length\nISO\nAperture\nShutter\n\n\n\n\nGlendevon reflections\n235mm\n2000\nf/8\n1/250s\n\n\nGlendevon\n160mm\n3200\nf/5.6\n1/250s\n\n\nGlendevon Bridge\n235mm\n3200\nf/5\n1/250s\n\n\n\nAll were tastefully post-processed using Capture One Pro 21."

    "text": "Three 120 films\n Kinghorn beach, Fife Hasselblad, E100\nI sort of lost track of photography in the first part of this year, not least film photography. There were 3 120 films kicking about for a while, which I eventually sent to AG on 3rd April 2021 for developing and scanning. The negatives came back all square, with telltale Hasselblad notches that told me they were taken in my 503CW.\n\n\n\nBrand\nType\nISO\nFormat\nExposures\nCamera\nLens\n\n\n\n\nKodak\nT-Max BW Pan\n400\n120\n12\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n\n\nKodak\nPortra\n160\n120\n12\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n\n\nKodak\nEktachrome E100\n100\n120\n12\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n\n\n\nI hadn’t been in the habit of recording exposure details this year, either, so there’s a bit of guesswork in identifying the subject of the images. From a digital note on my phone:\nTMY BW - From the Agfa?\nPortra 160 maybe Hasselblad\nE100 — Hasselblad on Kinghorn / Burntisland beach 3 April\nPossibly — Hasselblad Portra Crail\n1 rock at f/16 about 1/8s\n2 same Lee 10 stop 2 1/2 min inc 30 sec for rf\nScanned results were disappointing: dust on the BW, dust and only 11 frames on the Portra, and bands/rainbow stripes on the E100. AG said the dust wasn’t their problem, nor was the fact that I thought I had ordered TIFFs and received jpegs. I certainly won’t be using them again for this service, which was 35 quid on top of processing. They did offer to rescan the slides.\nI bought some Digitaliza negative holders from Lomography over the summer and tried them rescanning some of these images. I had to fight a bit with the Epson website to download the driver for the MacBook Air I am using, which runs macOS Big Sur 11.4 but the first scan out at 600 dpi wasn’t bad, and was certainly better than the scans I had from AG.\nThe next strip – the Digitaliza does a whole strip at a time – was from the Portra and was also OK. This image was an experiment with the super-dark Lee neutral density filter and a long exposure. It’s OK, and proves it can be done but it seems tasteless to me, to use film this way. I probably won’t do it again.\n Crail beach. Hasselblad 503CW with Lee Big Stopper\nThe last strip was of Kodak Ektachrome E100, for which I switched the scanner’s colour management off. These were very nice indeed, with just a trace of banding visible in the sky on a sunny walk on Kinghorn beach (see header image).\n Kinghorn Beach. Hasselblad 503CW hand held\nOne thing I am sure of, is that I don’t look after my film stock particularly well: it goes nowhere near a fridge, spending much of its life bashing around in a tin box in the boot of my car. I’m going to try to do something about that, maybe, before getting stressed out about the banding here: I did better than a professional scanning service."

    "text": "Slowly getting my head around analogue photography… a roll of 800 in my old Nikon FM.\n Trees at Glendevon in the snow\nI recently wrote about a trip to Kilminning up the Fife coast and the images I made with a Fuji GW690ii. Well, I also had with me a Nikon FM 35mm camera with some Kodak Portra 800 in it. This is a colour negative film, which cost £12.50 per roll from Analog Wonderland, and was eventually processed by AG Photolab once I’d finished it. I’m not processing my own colour film just yet.\n Sunset at Lower Largo. Obviously right down at f/22 and 1/1000s of a second, but still produced a flare at the top of the image (which I cropped out). Who points a camera at the sun?\nWhat I am finding is that I am preferring medium format for no other reason than it takes forever to finish a roll of 36 frames. If it’s a colour film, it can be literally months between closing the shutter and seeing the result, by which time my photography has moved on, or at least, I’ve forgotten what I was thinking at the time. It’s as if I become detached from the image: quite the reverse of my intention in returning to film. Perhaps I ought to up my game a bit: perhaps I’m over diverse. On most of our recent outings, I’ve had at least three cameras with me. I don’t think this is helping me much.\n Lower Largo. I like the sky.\nAccurate metering still evades me, but I feel I am getting a clearer understanding of this: I’ve started Ansel Adams’ The Negative in which he describes his Zone System for proper evaluation of a frame. With some understanding of this, maybe I’ll be less reliant on the “magic” of my phone’s app, or the little red LEDs in my Nikon, which rarely agree on what the correct exposure settings are.\n Castle Hill reservoir\nThe Portra emulsions have a characteristic colour palette that I like. It’s almost pastel: I think it’s probably more suited to brighter light than I have exposed it in this roll, which are mostly wintery scenes, most recently taken on a walk out at Glenquey reservoir. The top image, of trees at Glendevon in the snow, gains very little from the colours of Portra, for example.\n Bridge at Glendevon. White balance adjusted from the scanner’s default in Capture One. A bit more Portra-like, in my view.\nAnother aspect of this workflow that is bothering me is what the scanner assumes in the process. The colours and contrast often seem unimpressive. I can’t tell if it’s me or the device: I’m assuming it’s me at the moment, because I want to not overdo the post-processing. Here’s one that I adjusted white balance, a little clarity, and added just a touch of sharpening to. I quite like it.\n Glendevon\nThe whole point of analogue photography is that you fiddle as little as possible in the digital space.

This roll, I “semi-stand” developed in a highly dilute solution of 3 cm3 of Rodinal R09 in half a litre of water. The camera for this roll was Fuji GW690ii medium-format monster that shoots only 8 images per roll, each 6cm by 9cm wide. Scanned at 6400 dpi, that makes for over 300 Mega pixels. Not that anyone shooting film gives a monkey’s toss for pixel-peeping. I’m probably overdoing it by scanning at 6400 dpi, to be honest.\nWe took this beast of a camera up a local hill to catch the twilight at a favourite exercise spot of ours. We like the place because there are very few people there, so we can be socially responsible, get some fresh air and exercise, and take a few photographs.\n Common Hill\nSome of the frames in this film displayed the “streaks” I’ve been experiencing lately in all of my cameras and different film stock (you can see one in the image below). The common factor is the stand- or semi-stand development technique I have been using at home. Best advice from the old forums is that it’s a bad idea without a specific reason to use it, and that it is problematic: streaks are common, especially in 35mm film which has sprocket holes. It is suggested that Rodinal at 1:100 is fully exhausted after about 20 minutes, so longer than that is pointless, and that 5 minutes is the maximum time that should elapse between agitations under development.\n The Moon over Glendevon\nNot all of the images were streaky, however, and so the roll wasn’t a complete loss.

    "text": "A few days in the North West\n Thistles. Fuji X-T2\nFor our summer trip North this year, I took the Hasselblad 503CW and my Nikon FM with digital backup from a Ricoh GRIII and my Fuji X-T2. The Agfa stayed in the bag and the GW690ii stayed at home. There’s only so much gear one can carry.\nOne of the first beaches we headed for was Acheninver, a short walk from the hostel where we spent the first couple of nights. It was overcast for the first few days of our break, which was a blessing for us because the mobs were elsewhere. At the beach was a man filling builder’s bags with seaweed: curious, I asked him why. Crofter Steve Husband explained that there is a seaweed festival on Isle Martin in September and that a dry run of glassmaking had used the entire stock of seaweed, so he was replenishing. The seaweed is dried and burned with sand to make artisan glass, and burning kelp is an ancient tradition in the North. Some of the seaweed Steve had gathered looked good enough to eat, and indeed, it can be used for culinary purposes.\n Steve in his tractor with his Gaelic-speaking dog. Fuji X-T2\nThe next day, we tried out a new camping stove on Achmelvich beach, pushing the culinary boundaries by heating up a tin of sausages and beans. Classy. On our meander around the Coigach and Drumbeg, I tried a bit of sketching. Some way to go, I think.\n Achnahaird beach, sketch\nThe last few days were spent in Drumbeg House, or at least, in a self-contained house within the grounds of said House. This was a perfectly peaceful place to escape for a few days with its own cairn at the side of its own loch and a decent deer population to get us close to that Highland feeling.\n Young stag. Fuji X-T2\nWe were treated to a close encounter with one of these stags, at the point we were ready to give up hope of seeing the wildlife without a telephoto lens, when one wandered through the bracken and paused on the grass between the house and the loch, to gaze at us, neither of us knowing whether to grab a camera or just experience the moment.\n Keeper’s shed. Hasselblad 503CW, Kodak TMY 400\nThe old house has been renovated, we think under new ownership, perhaps to return to its former glory as an exclusive dining experience for those who do that kind of thing. Traces of a more private small estate are still seen in the grounds.\n 1907.

    "text": "Light leaks and lessons to be learned.\n\nThe first roll of photographs in 2021 was also a first time for me shooting Kodak Tri-X 400 film, and also the first roll through the Hasselblad 503CW I bought over Christmas. We couldn’t go to the Moon to shoot with this iconic camera, so we slogged it to the top of a local hill on a very chilly winter morning.\nIt was a crampon day, according to a chap we passed on the walk to Glenquey reservoir where our ascent started. He seemed confident enough on the icy path back down so we took it to be banter. As it turned out, we might have benefited from crampons as we took what turned out to be a harder route up the hill. We had poles, and wouldn’t have completed the climb without them for sure.\nI “stand” processed the film in Rodinal 1:100 for 60 minutes. The film was quite curly when it dried, so I cut it into strips and put it in a book1 for half an hour before scanning. Very quickly, as I scanned, a more serious issue presented itself.\n The first image from Innerdownie Hill.\nHere, we see a light leak, which comes from the left hand side of the film magazine as seen when shooting. This is disappointing, but I am assured by the very helpful and supportive community of Hasselblad film photographers that this is to be expected when buying an old camera. A proper inspection is required by people experienced in such things, and fortunately, I know of such people not far from where I live that can do that.\n\nThere is some question about whether I introduced problems during development, but I don’t think so, having used this method before without problem. If it had been a development issue, then the banding might have gone the other way (and appeared at the bottom of the frame). I am not confident I can explain the second (central vertical) stripe in the above image. There were two images on the roll with marks like this, and so there may have been something I didn’t do quite right in development. Another roll might help confirm this.\n\nThe variation in that flare on the right of each frame differs according to the shutter speed used. The longer exposures (such as the 1-second river image below) suffer with a greater effect, whereas in the short exposures (header image, 1/500s at f/22) it is less obvious.\n River, from the bridge 1 second at f/11\nAm I disappointed? Well, yes, of course, but perhaps my expectations weren’t reasonable. The camera and magazine are just over 20 years old and I have no idea what kind of life they have led. The lens is over 50 years old. It should be expected to have old equipment, used or not, well cared for or not, checked over properly before it functions as it should.\nThere is some consolation, in that I can recover enough in post processing to render a reasonable image. It’s cheating a bit, maybe, but Ansel Adams put a lot of effort into working up his negatives into a decent print. He regarded the negative as the “score” which is interpreted in the “performance” of processing and printing. With that in mind, here is Glendevon from the walk down Innerdownie hill, digitally cropped and processed in Capture One Pro 21:\n\n\n\nThe consensus from the Hasselblad Film Photography group on FB is to:\n\n… try another roll of film but use conventional agitation with less dilute developer, just to rule that out. If you still have the same problems after that, then you’ve got a light leak. All the same, light leaks aren’t hard or expensive to fix2, it’s usually a matter of replacing the foam seal around the dark slide, which you can do yourself with nothing more than a set of jeweller’s screwdrivers.\n\nAs it happens, the seller has offered to have the camera returned for repair. This is the logical next step.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the film\n\nOn reading the Kodak data sheet for the film stock, I might have over-exposed for the conditions on the hill, which problem may have been masked by stand processing. Most of the snowscape shots were taken at f/11, 1/125s, which is over the suggested f/22, 1/500s for Bright/Hazy Sun on Light Sand or Snow. I used my Nikon FM as a meter on the hill but quite possibly this is an unreliable witness: it had a number 8 yellow filter for which I had compensated 1/3 stop but the TriX data sheet suggests 2 stops for this filter. Next time, I’ll use my digital camera for metering.\n\nAbout old cameras\n\nIt is to be expected that older equipment needs to be maintained and looked after. If buying second hand, assume that inspection and sevice by an experienced technician is needed before you will get the best out of the investment, and budget for it.\n\nAbout stand developing\n\nFilm manufacturers produce data sheets that are worth following until you have enough experience to vary. There are situations where stand development is a good idea: perhaps where individual frames have been pushed. Reduced grain can be had also, but it doesn’t (and shouldn’t) compensate for bad focusing.\n\nAbout taking photographs\n\none or two of these images had definitely wonky horizons, and the focus wasn’t particularly good. Two basics to work on in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe images on this page were taken with the Hassleblad 503CW, Carl Zeiss 80mm F2.8 C planar lens."

First time out, I used a roll of Rollei Blackbird, which is rated at 64 ISO but seems to be quite laissez-faire about how you shoot it. I put it in my Agfa Isolette medium-format camera, which also seems to be quite laid back in respect of how long a film you put through it. No frame counters to get in the way of the abuse I was planning.\nA couple of 3D printed plastic adaptors1 allow you to fit a standard 135 film canister into the supply reel of the camera. I fed it onto the take-up spool and had counted on 2 and one third half-turns to be about enough for a 6cm wide image, which is what the camera is designed for. That only worked at the end of the roll2: the early images needed a bit more, and so ended up overlapping:\n Frames 11 – 16\nA crop from this image is in the header. Notice another small problem above, in the second frame from the left. Some of the images show a little crescent-shaped mark. 120 film has backing paper to protect the emulsion from this exposure: 135 does not, and so some of the images were spoiled from where I had (from habit) opened the window in the back of the camera to peek at the exposure counter, or from light leaks there. Next time I try this, maybe I’ll duct tape it.\n Frames 30 – 31\nThis image (Frames 30 – 31, above) gave away an issue that I think I’ve had with some of the images I’ve developed at home: streaks in the negative that can only have been introduced in the chemical processing. These look clearly to me like marks made by a fluid: the film perforations have been part of a disturbance in the fluid that has caused uneven development in the emulsion. I wonder, also, about the agitation of the film in the tank. This batch was two 135 films in the same tank, and I chose to use an inversion rather than using the swizzle stick in the Paterson tank. I think I need to read more about the whole process in order to understand what’s going on (and to do it better).\n\n\n Three rocks triptych\nFukukawatakashi need not worry I’m going to steal his thunder any time soon but I’m thankful to him (and most of the community of great photographers out there at the moment) for sharing their work and ideas.

We’d been to Patterdale several times and love the care that has been given to the preservation and development of the area. The Lakes have a distinct feel to them; it’s in the stones, and the local businesses, and even the vehicles.\n Patterdale, Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4\n The dark skies on our first night confounded the weather forecast and were a treat, and a challenge to our photography as we wrestled with remembering how to capture a night sky. Street lamps, industry, intruder lights and the like all usually conspire to deny the humbling sight of stars and galaxies overhead, and so I was certainly out of practice. I was reasonably pleased with this image, with the Orion Nebula, or NGC 1976 clearly seen as a smudge below Orion’s belt near the centre of the picture. NGC 1976 is a region of star formation, over 1,000 light-years away from us and yet still within our own Galaxy, the Milky Way. Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\n Goldrill Beck river, Patterdale Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\nOur home-from-home was on the road over the Goldrill Beck river on good walking routes. The bridge over the river is a classic spot to capture the iconic pastoral view looking Northwest towards Ullswater.\n Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\nThere were plenty of timeless sights to drink in as we walked the paths around the Southern end of Ullswater, which, if we had to state a preference, would be our favourite end. It feels more “Lake District”: walls are layered slates, buildings are, too. Raptors and smaller birds proudly converse and advertise their presence. People exchange pleasant conversation if they want to, or pass by, deep in their reveries. Others peek at you from behind walls, curious.\n Fuji X-T2, XF100-400mmF4.5-5.6 R\nWe didn’t venture too far on this trip, spending more time on our feet than in the car exploring. Sometimes we do more “drive-by shooting” in areas we don’t know too well, so as to try to get a sense of a place. That often doesn’t work but this break, we went slower, and breathed the place in better. Oh, for the life that gives the fullest opportunity for breathing places in.\n Brothers Water Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\nAt Aira Force (meaning waterfall, from Old Norse), we bimbled around snatching long and short exposures, chatting to other photographers who had travelled from far to capture a memory of the place. This is the kind of place that increasingly tests my surety of foot: the rocks are wet and slippery, paths are muddy, roots are deadly cunning. The effect of this environment is to slow me down even more now I’m older and less Weeble. This is a blessing: I see more.\n\n\n\n Aira Force Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\n\n\n Aira Force Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\n\n\n Air Force Fuji X-T2, XF100-400mm\n\n\n\n This is not to say that I see very much, of course. At Aira Force we saw or rather, heard then saw, a drone overhead with the owner standing aloof from danger on a nice dry, flat rock. The point of view from the mobile platform is always going to be better than wherever I can scramble to with my gear. The cameras in many of these devices are often on a par with any digital SLR. The Devil in me wanted first to throw a rock at the drone, then at the owner. Instead, I wondered whether drone photography is something else – something different to stills photography altogether. It’s a matter of choice and opportunity, I suppose, what medium an artist uses to tell a story. Images are part of that, perhaps, no matter how obtained, but the mental imagery they invoke might be more so.\nBuzzard, Fuji X-T2, XF100-400mm\n Chaffinch Fuji X-T2, XF100-400mm\nI carried two cameras as we walked; one for landscape, wider images, with a 16mm lens, and the other, with my monster Fuji XF100-400mmF4.5-5.6 R zoom to try to capture some of the wildlife. We saw more than I captured, including a much-signposted but not often seen red squirrel. The Air Force offered me a reminder to have the correct settings on at all times by flying low over Ullswater when I hadn’t (this jet was taken at 1/125s hand held on manual focus), but which helped me be a little more ready for robins and raptors.\n Fuji X-T2, XF100-400mm\nWe had planned the trip, sort of, by identifying some of the interesting places others had written about or shared. One of these was The Duke of Portland’s Boathouse at the Northern end of Ullswater, once the property of the 18th Century 3rd Duke of Portland, sold to save him from bankruptcy. Now, it’s a hugely overpriced holiday rental.\n The Duke of Portland’s Boathouse Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\nWe delayed the journey home after check-out time in order to enjoy a little serendipity. Driving up the Kirkstone Pass, I misunderstood the navigator and instead of turning into a car park at the top of the pass, headed down the road called “the Struggle” that leads to Ambleside and Lake Windermere. I pulled off the road to give us time to decide how far we would go down that road – we were not keen on visiting the denser touristy places, even at this time of year. When we checked the view, we decided it was a good place to eat the lunch we had bought in Glenridding.\n The Struggle Fuji X-T5, XF16mm f/1.4 R WR\nWe continued further to explore, finding a couple of interesting old pines at the side of the road. This is beautifully circular, as we had been staying in a place called, “Wordsworth Barn”, so named for the poet who onced owned the barn that is now a holiday rental.\n\nWordsworth Barn was quite wonderful, although, at 6’4”, I enjoyed a close personal relationship with the old beams. That aside, the host, Joan, had thought cleverly about what her guests need to know and have when staying here. We had booked for our basic needs – wood-burning stove, self-contained, superb location and ease of access to the things we wanted to see – and Joan had taken care of all of the things we didn’t think to specify, like every kind of glass we might use; dressing gowns; a bath and a shower; a personal welcome; thoughtful use of space; fresh milk and a bottle of fizz. None of the usual irritations, either: fuel for the log burner is included, recycling is easy and intelligently organised, everything works (although a builder’s knack is required to unlock the front door). We will be back.\nWordsworth was well known for his love of trees (Dale and Yen, 2022) and “wished to be remembered as a tree hugger” (Yen, 2022).

    "text": "Winter has its attractions, even if it isn’t all frosty and picturesque by the time we’re up and about. The camera is often the excuse to get up off the couch and out of the house, side benefits being clearing of the head and lungs, stretching of muscle and tendon and general wellbeing. This is true even if the photographs don’t turn out well. Or even if no photographs are taken at all, and the cameras effectively become ballast. Professional, I am not.\n Inchcolm Abbey, Fuji X-T5, XF100-400mm\nThat’s not to say I can’t swan about with a massive zoom lens and look like a professional. I did this on a short run to the Braefoot Bay marine terminal by Aberdour. We walked up to the Monk’s Cave, from where I zoomed in on the Abbey on Inchcolm island in the Forth. At 400mm, the foreshortening brings the distant ski slope much closer and amplifies the haze effect.\n Eurasian Curlew\nThe whole point of having the big lens on is to try to take photos of living things, which, being long time survivors of Man’s 7 million year evolution, know to keep a distance between themselves and a bloke in a bobble hat. I was pleased enough with this, quite possibly my first reasonable wildlife photograph. A combination of the long lens and my new X-T5’s 40MPixel file size gave scope for a crop which I think still renders nicely on screen.\n “Nevermore!”\nThese characters are everywhere, or at least, I hope it’s not the same one following me around. Again, a crop from a zoomed in image which allowed me to cover my composition errors. I forget who it was who said that they never crop, always capturing the intended photograph in the viewfinder. There’s elegence in that idea that I admire but I suspect that not many world-class captures use every pixel that hits the sensor. There’s legitimate art in the post-capture processing and adjustments, I think.\n Fuji X-T2, Nikon A-iS 85mm f/1.4\nI love the textures everywhere. My wife and I discussed what this image might be called and couldn’t really think of anything we could put on a public website. I’m just going to move along to the grasses at the edge of the tide’s reach along the shore, which offer movement and colour.\n Fuji X-T2, Nikon A-iS 85mm f/1.4\nI want to call this, “Neapolitan” for the bands of colour, like ice cream.\n The Bridges Fuji X-T2, Nikon A-iS 85mm f/1.4\nWe meandered home past the rising tide today and, looking back towards the bridges, across the sands of Pettycur Bay, felt thankful for all the privilege we enjoy, living close by to these amazing places."

    "section": "",
    "text": "During late November and early December, my job has required me to make visits to schools. The schedule can be challenging so I always try to arrive around 20 minutes early so as to check any messages, and enter the school with grace and dignity. On this cycle of visits, I thought I’d use the extra time to also practice some sketching.\n Linlithgow Academy\nThere is a rationale for this habit. Sketching is a deliberate, mindful process, even when done quickly. It helps you see what is there, and the looking doesn’t stop when the sketchbook is closed. At Linlithgow, I found myself studying wall displays, people, the dynamic of school reception spaces, looking at shapes and patterns as much as inscriptions. I even got the chance to assist some not-yet-detective material police officers in their hunt for the reception desk, being able to indicate the huge sign that my fine-tuned sketcher’s observational skills had spotted in the lobby.\n Deans Community High School\nWe continue to invest in building new schools to replace older, more out of date infrastructure. This is a good thing for many reasons including sending a message to the country that education is important and valuable to us all. Whilst every school is different, certain design features and material choices appear in many of the recent builds, perhaps dating them. This is not to say they look the same – they do, in some respects, but each has its own features according to the perceived needs of the community they serve.\n Kirkcaldy High School\nI taught Physics and Mathematics at Kirkcaldy High School for a number of years before replacing my own tutor at Moray House. I’m not going to reminisce about this old place but it was nice to go back for a visit and see friends and former colleagues again. I was reminded that cultures are slow to change and that whilst rolling stones may gather no moss, they do gather experience you don’t get standing still.\n Preston Lodge High School\nBunsen burners, magnesium strips and good dialogic pedagogy made my job easy at Preston Lodge today. All the nicer to see more old friends, too. Education is a village, and once you’ve been at it a while, it can feel like going home when you meet again, people who have shared different parts of your journey. Conversations pick up where they left off, friendship hugs shock the pupils, and mutual respect is grown and shared from stories of careers unfolding. I love it when new teachers see that: they are enculturated into their vocation through the modelled behaviours of those that go before them, and shape them. There’s more to this than Vygotksy, or Bruner, or the latest educational fad.\n Portobello High School\nPreston Lodge and Portobello sketches are not the best likeness to the real thing, for similar reasons. At Preston Lodge, my view from the car was obscured by a large van and so I had to interpret and sketch what I felt was there. Isn’t that the point, though? The American photographer David Alan Harvey said, “Don’t shoot what it looks like. Shoot what it feels like.” This is my motivation in photography as much as in sketching, and exploring that idea is the principal reason for me wanting to sketch more often. At Portobello, a different large van also obscured the view, and I don’t have the confidence quite to stand in a car park sketching, in full view of the CCTV. I had a call to go in to school anyway, so I took a quick photo on my phone and sketched it up later in a café over lunch. From this experience, I think I do a better job sketching live, en plein air, than from a photo. Something seems to be missing in my drawing from a photo, at least where my skills are at present. Perhaps that will change with practice.\n The lorry at Leith, with a fast rat\nLeith Academy has a nice front façade but you can’t see it from where I parked, and the back of the building is ugly, so I sketched the random lorry in the car park instead. I did not find out what the vehicle does, or why it’s there, but it looks arty to me, even if it seems past its best service days. Leith has always felt like an arty school: it has interesting shaped science labs which are full of scope and character, even if some of the electrical infrastructure also seems past its best service days. The teachers are anything but, of course, nor the businesslike head teacher who introduced himself as I was preparing to leave for my next appointment. It’s great that there are schools like Leith who put the effort and investment into new teachers, for the wider good of Scottish education.\n Musselburgh Grammar School\nThere is a quid pro quo, of course, in the benefit that mentors and other colleagues get from watching rookies make naïve mistakes and offering guidance and advice from experience, at the same time tapping in to new ideas and reconnecting to the principles of pedagogy that are fresh in the student teachers’ thinking. This was articulated in both schools I visited today by the supporting teachers who played their important part in bringing about fair and just evaluation of how their charges have progressed.\n Queensferry CHS, in the fog\nThere was a thick fog for my journey across the Forth to Queensferry and I almost bottled doing the sketch because I don’t know how to draw fog. I had a word with myself and thought, “just put the pen marks where it’s dark, and don’t put them where it’s light”. Easier said than, done, I think, so I diverted myself by trying to capture a couple of figures approaching the pool of light from the lamp. I remember a sketcher artist I follow said that figures add interest to a sketch. I think they are right, but I prefer the Leith rat, if I’m honest.\n Deans CHS again\nBack to Deans again and a view from a different part of the car park. It’s interesting how varied these buildings can look, depending on where you look from. My wife calls my style “Roobarb”, for the unsteady hand that wiggles the lines. I did get an ‘O’ level many years ago in technical drawing, so I do know how to use a ruler but when I’m trying to work quickly – none of these sketches took more than about 10 minutes – the look is more one of impression than technical accuracy. I was conscious that I was cold sitting in the car at Deans and so the lines were more Roobarb than usual, perhaps. More figure suggestions, though, and they seem to be growing on me. I’m quite pleased with the silver birch, too, given that I’m not giving myself time to make 10,000 strokes for the leaves.\n Dingwall\nA long but pleasant drive up beyond Inverness took me to new territory, and once more found me shaking hands with colleagues who had passed through my tutorials at Moray House. It’s lovely to see the products of my labour thriving and making their mark on young people across the country. I am taking all the credit, of course, as I will for the superb teacher whose lesson on nuclear fission was one of the best I have ever seen. It’s not all me, of course: a lot of work goes in to becoming a teacher, especially a good one, and you have to bring a lot of things, too. Attitude, aptitude, wit, intelligence, humour, resilience, just to mention a few. Those who bring all of that with them perhaps don’t need much from me to succeed, but I do like to tell myself that I help them excel.\n Broxburn Academy\nAs the weeks of touring schools come to an end for this session at least, I feel that I have been inspired by students, colleagues and the young people in schools. The student teachers have a steep learning curve, especially on their first school placement. Workload can be an issue, and both schools and the university urge the students to try to find a good, healthy, sustainable balance. I asked some of them what their “secret” is for managing this. All said that the balance is crucial to survival, and that part of that is remaining physically active through sport or exercise. Some of them run; others swim or play a sport. This advice I took myself today by going for a run in the early morning darkness.\nVehicles are often a challenge for schools at the beginning and end of the day, even more so when parking is limited, so the final visit of the tour found me arriving at my destination later than planned. I parked in a quiet residential area and enjoyed a walk through the catchment instead of having time to sketch. By now, I was thinking that although every school is different, I had probably sketched enough fairly-recently-built school buildings to have a good appreciation for their character."

    "text": "A photograph is a secret about a secret. The more it tells you the less you know.\n– Diane Arbus\nSpeaking of Kings, we went for a walk in Pittencrieff Park (known locally as “The Glen”). We were hunting for autumn leaves for an artsy project, specifically Oak. A walk in a park is never a bad idea in my book, and it gave me a chance to re-introduce myself to the big Fuji XF100-400mm zoom lens that I got back from service and repair this week.\nDunfermline Abbey\nKing Charles III recently formally conferred city status on Dunfermline, during his first joint royal visit with the Queen Consort since the death of Queen Elizabeth. The townsfolk turned out for the occasion, which is nice, even if some were apparently a little unkind to our First Minister. I couldn’t possibly comment.\nThe Abbey and Abbey Church were basking in the early autumn glow. I love how the light played around the buttresses of this old place, which has quite a history. Walking down into the Glen, the colurs in the Japanese Garden were no less magical.\nJapanese Acer\nThe contrast was strong as we explored some of the nooks and crannies. Sunlight danced on water and dappled through the leaves, reflecting and re-reflecting greens and reds, oranges and yellows between dark and mysterious Tolkienesque shadows.\nThe Waterfall on Tower Burn.\nWhat the Americans call a Sqrl. There are plenty of these in and around Dunfermline (squirrels, although there are a fair number of Americans, even at this time of year). They have a sense of humour, of course, and will run right across the feet of anyone with a camera just to watch them fumble for focus and fail.\nAlliums in the formal garden. We walked here after pausing for a breakfast roll at the Peacock Room, and chatting to an old friend I hadn’t seen for 20 years. That was a pleasant surprise and oddly, enabled me to fill in a couple of gaps from a particular period in my life. Nothing major, more an ironing out of wrinkles in a shirt I haven’t worn for a while, but a resolution nonetheless.\nThis iconic peacock is one of a number in the park. There is a new enclosure following the recent mindless attack that resulted in the injury of one bird and the death of another, Malcolm, named for the King whose wife Margaret established the Abbey. More help is needed to support the volunteers who put heart and soul into caring for these beautiful creatures. If you can help, please drop them a few quid. Thank you, and thanks for reading."

We have not often chosen the Borders over our more usual favourite direction of North but wanted, as usual, a decent distance from hustle and bustle, nature and a wood-burning stove to curl up in front of at the end of the day. A place to read, reflect, walk and enjoy life together. Not far from Hawick, the Summer House offers all of that and more.\nThe Summer House from the lake\nThis place has been fairly recently renovated and is cosy, warm and spacious enough for families and small groups to enjoy the stunning countryside here. There is a lake close by with swans and moorhens. A young deer met us on the driveway as we headed on to the estate. Owls serenaded the night. An otter played chicken with us in the road and then blew otter raspberries from the safety of a hedge."

The Summer House includes artefacts of the three Abrahamic faiths of Islam, Christianity and Judaism.\n The Basmala appears at threshholds to the old and new summerhouse. The older summer house is in the walled garden, which is well tended by the gardner and a team of volunteers who give service as a form of study and reflection. Quotes from Bulent Rauf and others suggest that central to the teachings of the Institute is unity of life and self discovery. On the hill above the house is the Monument to Man:\n The Monument to Man above the estate has engraved around the circumference, “ALL ARE FROM HIM AND TO HIM THEY RETURN”, resonant with similar phrases in the Bible (e.g. Romans 11:36) and the Qu’ran (e.g. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:156). In the ground near to the monument, with its four pillars representing Chisholme’s own pillars of work, study, meditation and zikr, is a circular stone bearing the inscription:\n\nO CONFIDENT SOUL, RETURN TO YOUR LORD, AGREEING AND AGREED TO ENTER AMONG MY SERVANTS AND ENTER MY PARADISE\n\nThis is a variation of another well known passage from the Qu’ran, Surah 89, Al-Fajr (Dawn, verses 26 – 30)."

Our weekend at the summer house gave us time and space to discuss things that concern us and things that make us. We took time and space to see ourselves more clearly and shared life and laughter. We resolved to act, and to not act, on these things. Chisholme draws on Lao Tsu for some of its teaching, describing it:\n\nThe philosophy of Lao Tsu is simple: Accept what is in front of you without wanting the situation to be other than it is. Study the natural order of things and work with it rather than against it, for to try to change what is only sets up resistance.\n\nI think this understates Lao Tsu’s recognition of man’s free will and ability to use it. On the way home, we took advice from the Hadith:\n\nAnas ibn Malik reported: A man said, “O Messenger of Allah, should I tie my camel and trust in Allah, or should I leave her untied and trust in Allah?” The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Tie her and trust in Allah.”\nSource: Sunan al-Tirmidhī 2517"

Birds are many and diverse: it is easy to see a host of sea birds in and around the machar and on the hillsides are Golden Eagles, Hen Harriers and short-eared owls hunting in the daytime.\n\n Locals Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm\nThe diversity of the wildlife is noticeable for visitors like us from the central belt of Scotland. We seem to have a disproportionate seagull population and we can probably do with less of the fat pigeons and magpies, frankly.\n Where once working families lived, now stand more mechanised, efficient farming practices that make use of the land by fewer humans. A still nascent tourism industry is booked to capacity and locals still wave as visitors yield the right of way in the passing places. There is potential for development of abandoned plots and buildings across the islands. I hope that never comes to spoil the place.\n The roadside food wagon is no innovation nor is it a quaint enterprise: the food is home-made, delicious and locally sourced. You have to try the scallops and black pudding roll. Radio buzzers notify in your car when your lunch is ready and yes, they take contactless American Express. Check out the recycling bins. Even the coffee-cup lids are made of paper pulp. The Outer Hebrideans are right on trend when it comes to sustainable service.\n Sea birds abound along the shorelines and there are sites of special scientific interest intended to protect the diverse species, not least those that depend on the environment to breed and thrive. There are as many halfwits who will open gates to drive their SUVs across these spaces to access their picnics, of course but we think we saw at least one person openly challenge such behaviour.\n Most precious and beautiful of the environmental backdrop here is the machair. It is looked after and protected, as far as one can protect from human activity. Here may be common buttercups and clover but if you look, you can see many kinds of orchid."

    "text": "Au Revoir\n This image will give you a sense of what we had hoped for when we headed North on our holiday. That image is actually a stitch of 8 images taken with the X-T2 and 35mm f/2 lens. Each image was exposed at f/8, 1/125s at ISO 200 and assembled into a panorama in Capture One. It should make a nice print about 50 inches x 20 inches if I ever get around to that.\nOur sixth island of the trip was Skye, of course, our gateway to the Outer Hebrides. The hills and skies of Skye are something to behold: a mere photograph, least of all a digital image on a computer screen, can’t give you anything like the sense of being there. I tried with images like this pano, taken from the side of the road on the way from Carbost, not far from Sligachan where this series of posts began.\n\nThe Broadford Co-Op was full of surprises. The cheapest diesel I’ve bought for weeks, and the right range of snacks for the rest of the journey home. Oh, and this view from the car park:\n\nWhat we got from our trip was much better than we had hoped for, of course. We had the chance to explore and learn, visit and revisit under changing skies and light. We left with just the tip of a toe dipped in Hebridean life. In the end, I only took one photo with the Agfa. I forget what it was but no doubt it will pop out in a few months."

    "text": "My first “proper” camera was a Nikon FM SLR, which I bought second hand around 1977 in Hitchin with a 50mm F1.4 NIKKOR Ai-S lens. I soon after bought a Tamron 80-210mm zoom lens that I used from the 1980s until around 2002 when I boxed it all up and hid it for a few years. I have no idea what happened to the 50mm lens but the body was checked out by Lehmanns in 2019 who condemned the shutter mechanism as BER1.\nI bought another Nikon FM from SE Cameras in April 2019 for £90, along with a Nikon AI-s 50mm f/1.8 lens from the same seller for £80. That lens is one of the cheaper E series lenses and I’m not totally happy with the quality of it, so I have bought a Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8 lens on eBay for £169. The 28mm and 50mm lenses have a standard 52 mm filter ring.\n The second Nikon FM at Euston Station\nHaving had some problems with light leaks with the eBay FM, I took it to Cameratiks in Morningside for a CLA, along with my orginial “condemned” FM and the Fuji GW690ii. For a couple of hundred quid, I got not only my “mint” condition eBay bargains back in decent working order, they also manged to return my original FM to full working condition.\nIn March 2022, under the influence of COVID, I bought a Used Nikon 85mm F1.4 AiS Lens from Harrison Cameras in Sheffield for £500 inc free P&P. The 85mm lens has a ø of 72 mm. Ordered a lens hood and spare lens cap from a random place on the internet for twenty quid."

Until recently – the past decade, perhaps – I have had a camera to hand if, on the spur of a moment, I needed to capture the scene. In the 20th century, it was a lot less usual for there to be a serendipidous camera available: the act of photography was more deliberate, usually requiring planning of some kind. That said, my family were no strangers to photography, and I am lucky enough to have inherited albums of photographs of relatives and their memories. Here is my mother with her grandfather and a chicken: the image connects me to the stories she told of him, and his chickens, and the days she grew up in Letchworth before and during The War. She was a keen follower of the habits of her age and captured moments in her life on still and cine film.

    "text": "Image copyright © 2020 Cambrian Photo, Colwyn Bay\nI bit the bullet on my first Hasselblad on Boxing Day 2020. Experts will immediately notice that it’s a bit of a Frankenblad, with an incongruous silver 1960’s lens on a millennial 503CW body and magazine. There are fans of the older silver lenses, so perhaps it’s not so monstrous a combination. Optically, the older lenses aren’t any different to the newer ones, and the multi-coating of the T* lenses was more about marketing than optical performance, according to Ken Rockwell. What I have discovered is that the previous owner knew his Hasselblads and that this is a very good combination indeed.\n\n\nMy wife and I met a guy one frosty morning, out in the countryside with a Hasselblad while his other half was at a car boot sale. He had bought the camera but was unable to tell his wife. I am more fortunate, and my wife is not averse to me owning a Hasselblad but we are both educators and not that flush, so a little humility and frugality is in order. She has helped me be smart and not so impulsive, and had me talk her through the due diligence and research I have done since that first GAS1 attack a year ago. That said, I have had encouragement in my desire to own a Hasselblad camera system:\n\n\ndo it ; - )\n\n— Dr David Mitchell (@DSM888) December 2, 2020\n\n\nThe piece I refer to in that Tweet is David’s personal reflection on the Japan Camera Hunter blog, in which he sketches the history of Hasselblad and his own passion for the brand. In that post, David describes the development of the cameras from the early models with focal plane shutters and Kodak lenses, to the copal shuttered Zeiss glass that has been part of the success of the V-series. It is these cameras, that became known as the V-series, that I’m keen to explore. David makes an important point that resonates with me:\n\n“Good design is discreet and intuitive – if it feels like it should do something then well designed things often do – it’s Mac vs PC for me…”\n\n\n\n\nThere are separate and distinct parts to the V-system that need to work together to make a camera. The lens attaches to and works with the body to capture light. The body is more than just a box to mount things on to: it houses the controls, the mirror (these are single-lens reflex cameras) and provides the framework for the other system components to interface with. The viewfinder is for the operator to compose the scene with, focusing on the screen. The back captures the image on to film or a digital sensor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction\nModel\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n1957 – 1970\n500 C\nOriginal Compur leaf-shutter\n\n\n1970 – 1994\n500 CM\nUser-changeable screen\n\n\n1988 – 1994\n503 CX\nBuilt-in TTL flash meter, “Palpas” shutter coating, improved Acute Matte screen\n\n\n1994 – 1997\n501 C\nComplete kit, A12 magazine, 80mm lens\n\n\n1997 – 2005\n501 CM\nThe best Acute Matte D screen, CW winder, better internal coatings\n\n\n1996 – 2013\n503 CW\nImproved mirror system\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 500 series cameras, including the super-wide angle SWx (which have fixed lenses), all have a shutter speed from 1 second to 1/500 s (hence the series name). A leaf shutter is in the lens. Later 2000/200 series bodies revert to a focal plane shutter which can fire at up to 1/2000 s. Those have proved to be less reliable than leaf shutters.\nWhilst many reviewers and vloggers have 500 CMs, and I really don’t care about flash, the newer models with better mirrors, second shutter coatings and a bright screen seem to be more attractive for a first investment. The newer, slightly larger mirrors in the 503CW and 501CM only make a significant difference with long lenses (in the viewfinder, the older ones have more vignetting).\n\n\nThe C indicates compur-shutter compatible, and M is a modified designation. CX and improved CXi are TTF/OTF X-sync flash compatible. The SWA super-wide angle bodies are based on the older series one and two cameras (1000 and 1600). On the lenses, F indicates a focal plane shutter with additional letters to indicate compatibility: FC, FCM and FCW are compatible with Compur lenses.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of detail out there on the range of lenses in the V-system, and again, Emulsive is your starting point for this. Pertinent details are that most of the lenses are Zeiss glass, with the C T* designation indicating multicoatings. The “standard” V-series lens is the Zeiss Planar C 80mm f/2.8, being the diameter of the 56mm square image at the film, and being close to “normal” vision. Some initial preferences for a lens:\n\n\n\nName\nf\nMax\nMin\nUsage\nFilter\nShutter\n\n\n\n\nDistagon\n50mm\nf/4\nf/22\nLandscape\n63 mm\nCompur Synchro\n\n\nDistagon\n60mm\nf/3.5\nf/22\nLandscape\nB60\nCompur Synchro\n\n\nPlanar C\n80mm\nf/2.8\nf/22\nGeneral\nB60\nCompur Syncro\n\n\nPlanar CF\n80mm\nf/2.8\nf/22\nGeneral\nB50\nProntor CF\n\n\nPlanar\n100mm\nf/3.5\nf/22\nTele, high resolution\nB50\nCompur Synchro\n\n\nSonnar C\n150mm\nf/4\nf/32\nPortrait\nB50\nCompur Synchro\n\n\nSonnar C\n250mm\nf/5.6\nf/45\nPortrait\nB50\nCompur Synchro\n\n\nTele-Tessar C\n350mm\nf/5.6\nf/45\nTele\nB50\nCompur Synchro\n\n\n\nC/CT* lenses are earlier, often found in chrome. They have self-timers and an automatic depth of field indicator (two red marks). C lenses can be used on any V system camera that has interchangeable lenses (i.e. all except the SWC). The T indicates multicoating. Note that the 80mm kit C lens sold with the 501C camera is in fact a modified CF lens. Most C/CT* lenses take B50 bayonet filters.\nCF lenses are less “pointy” in appearance and have B60 bayonet filters (because the end of the barrel is wider than the C/CT* lenses). The barrel includes hyperfocal distance scales. The F indicates that the lens is compatible with focal plane shutter bodies. Prontor CF shutters are more reliable than Compur Synchro.\n Earthrise This is the iconic image taken on Christmas Eve, 1968 by Bill Anders during the Apollo 8 mission, on a Hasselblad EL/M and Zeiss Sonnar f/5.6 250mm lens. The Command Module Hasselblad electric camera was normally fitted with an 80mm f/2.8 Zeiss Planar lens, but a bayonet-mount 250mm lens could be fitted for long-distance Earth/Moon photos (NASA). See also Wex’s and NASA’s articles on the Apollo 11 cameras.\n\n\n\nHasselblad have made improvements with each iteration of the film backs: the later type IV backs have a dark slide holder which I imagine will be a very smart thing to have for a system in my hashy hands. If there’s a nice safe place to put the dark slide, then I’m less likely to sit on it or drop it in a river. This Hasselblad is going outdoors. Ken Rockwell has a simple guide: there are four generations of A type film magazines (“backs”). There’s no functional difference between them.\n\n\n\nAt best I was looking for a 501 CM or 503 CW with a 42204 screen; an A12 Type IV back; waist-level viewfinder; and preferably a late model 80mm C (CF) Planar lens (although a good early one is OK). Things to watch for:\n\nThat the body, screen and back are of similar age\nSerial numbers of back, roll carrier and dark slide match (last 3 digits)\n\nWhat I settled on was this:\n\n\n\nBack\nBody\nLens\nVF\nScreen\n\n\n\n\nA12 IV SS 00\n503CW EU 97\n80mm F2.8 C 67\nWL\nAcute Matte\n\n\n\nYou do have to take your time and do your homework, I am learning. eBay is not usually the right place to buy anything over £100, because it’s full of crims and druggies. There are good sellers there, however, including reputable businesses. Ken Rockwell’s guide is right on the money when it comes to evaluating sellers:\n\n“The seller’s feedback rating is a better predictor of the quality of an item than his description of it.”\n\nKen suggests that:\n\n“Good feedback ratings are 99.8% and above. Bad feedback ratings are 99.6% and below. Don’t even consider buying from anyone with much less of a feedback rating than 99.5%.

    "text": "My wife and I met a guy one frosty morning, out in the countryside with a Hasselblad while his other half was at a car boot sale. He had bought the camera but was unable to tell his wife. I am more fortunate, and my wife is not averse to me owning a Hasselblad but we are both educators and not that flush, so a little humility and frugality is in order. She has helped me be smart and not so impulsive, and had me talk her through the due diligence and research I have done since that first GAS1 attack a year ago. That said, I have had encouragement in my desire to own a Hasselblad camera system:\n\n\ndo it ; - )\n\n— Dr David Mitchell (@DSM888) December 2, 2020\n\n\nThe piece I refer to in that Tweet is David’s personal reflection on the Japan Camera Hunter blog, in which he sketches the history of Hasselblad and his own passion for the brand. In that post, David describes the development of the cameras from the early models with focal plane shutters and Kodak lenses, to the copal shuttered Zeiss glass that has been part of the success of the V-series. It is these cameras, that became known as the V-series, that I’m keen to explore. David makes an important point that resonates with me:\n\n“Good design is discreet and intuitive – if it feels like it should do something then well designed things often do – it’s Mac vs PC for me…”"

    "text": "There are separate and distinct parts to the V-system that need to work together to make a camera. The lens attaches to and works with the body to capture light. The body is more than just a box to mount things on to: it houses the controls, the mirror (these are single-lens reflex cameras) and provides the framework for the other system components to interface with. The viewfinder is for the operator to compose the scene with, focusing on the screen. The back captures the image on to film or a digital sensor."

    "text": "The 500 series cameras, including the super-wide angle SWx (which have fixed lenses), all have a shutter speed from 1 second to 1/500 s (hence the series name). A leaf shutter is in the lens. Later 2000/200 series bodies revert to a focal plane shutter which can fire at up to 1/2000 s. Those have proved to be less reliable than leaf shutters.\nWhilst many reviewers and vloggers have 500 CMs, and I really don’t care about flash, the newer models with better mirrors, second shutter coatings and a bright screen seem to be more attractive for a first investment. The newer, slightly larger mirrors in the 503CW and 501CM only make a significant difference with long lenses (in the viewfinder, the older ones have more vignetting).\n\n\nThe C indicates compur-shutter compatible, and M is a modified designation. CX and improved CXi are TTF/OTF X-sync flash compatible. The SWA super-wide angle bodies are based on the older series one and two cameras (1000 and 1600). On the lenses, F indicates a focal plane shutter with additional letters to indicate compatibility: FC, FCM and FCW are compatible with Compur lenses."

    "text": "There is a lot of detail out there on the range of lenses in the V-system, and again, Emulsive is your starting point for this. Pertinent details are that most of the lenses are Zeiss glass, with the C T* designation indicating multicoatings. The “standard” V-series lens is the Zeiss Planar C 80mm f/2.8, being the diameter of the 56mm square image at the film, and being close to “normal” vision.

They have self-timers and an automatic depth of field indicator (two red marks). C lenses can be used on any V system camera that has interchangeable lenses (i.e. all except the SWC). The T indicates multicoating. Note that the 80mm kit C lens sold with the 501C camera is in fact a modified CF lens. Most C/CT* lenses take B50 bayonet filters.\nCF lenses are less “pointy” in appearance and have B60 bayonet filters (because the end of the barrel is wider than the C/CT* lenses). The barrel includes hyperfocal distance scales. The F indicates that the lens is compatible with focal plane shutter bodies. Prontor CF shutters are more reliable than Compur Synchro.\n Earthrise This is the iconic image taken on Christmas Eve, 1968 by Bill Anders during the Apollo 8 mission, on a Hasselblad EL/M and Zeiss Sonnar f/5.6 250mm lens. The Command Module Hasselblad electric camera was normally fitted with an 80mm f/2.8 Zeiss Planar lens, but a bayonet-mount 250mm lens could be fitted for long-distance Earth/Moon photos (NASA). See also Wex’s and NASA’s articles on the Apollo 11 cameras."

    "text": "Ricoh GRIII\n Trøllkonufingur, Faroes February 2020\nRicoh is a brand within the Pentax stable and is well known for the quality of its cameras. I bought a GRIII to have as my “go-anywhere” camera, on the principle that the best camera to have is the one in your hand. It has an 18.3mm focal length lens, which is nicely wide enough to cover almost any opportunity. The sensor is a 24 megapixel APS-C and the camera is fitted with in-body image stabilisation and a fast, clever hybrid contrast and phase detection autofocus system. Like the Fuji X-series mirrorless cameras, it also lacks an anti-aliasing filter on the sensor and thus renders high quality detail.\n Robert Watson-Watt, Brechin, November 2019\nThe GRIII is built on the brand loyalty established by Ricoh with the earlier compact film cameras and the first two iterations of the digital GR. It has become a favourite of street photographers, so much so that in 2020, they released a special “street” version with a gold lens ring. I lost my original black ring and replaced it with a gold coloured after-market copy so I could be like I am down with the street kids.\n Trælanípan, Faroes, February 2020\nThe image quality of this little camera always surprises me. It’s not that I’m a slow learner, but for the little sensor and tiny lens, the images this portable pocket machine produces are just remarkable. The only problem I have with the camera is that my wife has discovered how good it is. If I could have one camera, and one camera only, I think my GRIII would be it."

It’s really just my reference. Not all of these were scanned, and most of them aren’t on this site. Ask if you’re particularly interested.\nI got out of the habit of pedantically recording every frame setting after about a year of doing it. Once I’d let go of that habit, I lost the opportunity to efficiently learn all of the variables and their influence on the outcome of a capture but hugely improved the enjoyment of photography. It became less neurotic: more art than science: although the science is still there, it’s more in the moment. I believe that the process of photography becomes more significant and the reward for me is not so much in the outcomes, although these are sometimes pleasing, as in the creative process itself.

    "text": "Ilford Ortho 80\n\nBlack and white orthochromatic film, cost £12.50 per roll from Analog Wonderland. Loaded 13th July 2020, final frames wasted as I put the camera in for CLA. Used without a filter, which was a stupid mistake. I eventually got the film developed at AG photographic as things got busy and I just couldn’t find time to develop this (and other) films myself.\nAll of the frames in this roll were affected by light leaks but also showed up really bright skies at Clachtoll. This is maybe not surprising, given that the film is orthochromatic and insensitive to red: I probably went with the meter reading in the camera which isn’t, and so over exposed the sky. I should have used a filter. I think I also shot too wide and ended up with poor depth of the field for some of the compositions. The Salmon cottage image here took some work with curves in Capture One to get reasonable results.\n Salmon Cottage\nPerhaps the best images on this film were the ones I ran off of the car in the street: they were much contrastier but showed focus problems beyond about 5 metres. One I didn’t touch in post-processing is at the top of this post.\n Buachaille Etive Mór\nI might try this film again but in better light, and with a yellow filter for the sky.\n\n\n\nBrand\nType\nISO\nFormat\nExposures\nCamera\nLens\n\n\n\n\nIlford\nOrtho\n80\n35mm\n36\nNikon FM\nNikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrame\nImage\nAperture\nShutter\nComment\n\n\n\n\n1.\nClachtoll beach\nf/22\n1/125s\n13th July\n\n\n2.\nClachtoll beach\nf/16\n1/125s\n\n\n\n3 - 5.\nWaves\nf/8\n1/1000s\nClachtoll\n\n\n6.\nWrench rock\nf/11\n1/250s\nClachtoll\n\n\n7., 8.\nSalmon bothy\nf/11\n1/250s\nClachtoll\n\n\n9.\nArdvreck castle\nf/11\n1/1250s\n14th July\n\n\n10.\nSheds at Ballachulish\nf/5.6\n1/60s\nhand held\n\n\n11.\nGlencoe\nf/11\n1/30s\nh.h.\n\n\n12.\nEtive Mór\nf/16\n1/30s\n\n\n\n13.\nEtive Mór\nf/11\n1/60s\n\n\n\n14.\nBuachaille Etive Mór\nf/22\n1/8s\nportrait\n\n\n15.\nCottage at Glen Etive\nf/5.6\n1/125s\n\n\n\n16.\nCottage at Glen Etive\nf/8\n1/60s\nportrait\n\n\n17.\nBelhaven sands towards Bass Rock\nf/16\n1/125s\n18th July\n\n\n18.\nBass Rock posts\nf/16\n1/125s\n\n\n\n19.\nBeach posts\nf/22\n1/60s\n\n\n\n20.\nBeach posts\nf/16\n1/125s\n\n\n\n21., 22.\nBeach posts\nf/22\n1/8s\n0.6ND filter\n\n\n23.\nBeach posts\nf/22\n1/60s\n0.6ND filter\n\n\n24.\nKids playing\nf/5.6\n1/500s\n\n\n\n25.\nKids playing\nf/8\n1/1000s"

    "text": "Kodak Portra 160\n\nI loaded my Nikon FM 2567473 with a roll of Kodak Portra 160 film in February 2022. The roll was exposed with my new-to-me bokeh monster Nikon AI-s 85mm f/1.4 lens. Most of the roll was used during our Easter break to Clach Toll.\n Split Rock Croft, from the adjacent hill\nOn the road up (we love a road trip), there was, as always, a million amazing sights to see by the side of the road. It gets hard at times to stop safely – here is the difference between the Pacific NorthWest and Scotland, both incredible places to drive and explore but Scotland has yet to develop its tourist senses. It’s quite hostile to all forms of visitor, whether Americans, Japanese Knotweed, or Scots from the central belt. In Washington State, BC and Oregon there are plenty of places to stop and take photographs, camp, barbecue, rest and relax. In Scotland these are situated every 200 miles and have the capacity for 3 vehicles. They Scots will expect you to pay for the privilege too.\n Loch Glascharnoch from an overused lay-by on the A835 heading North\nOK, I’m exaggerating a little but the difference is tangible. North Americans have a lot of space and so can afford to be generous with facilities. They also have a well developed sense of “le weekend”, living for it more than we do in the UK, where if you’re not doing a 48 hour week, you’re not even really interested in your job, are you?\n Staic Pollaidh\nWe had a wonderful break at Clach Toll: the split rock landmark marks one of our favourite beaches at any time of year. We were lucky enough to catch one of the last bookings available of the Air B’n’B at Split Rock Croft, before the owners, who had made themselves famous on the BBC’s “This Farming Life”, closed up and left for pastures new.\n Life\nThe photos might give a sense of the place, with its private beach below the famous split rock and intimate connection to the environment.\n The private beach at Split Rock Croft\nI lost the notes from the final few frames and the film sat in a drawer at home until I sent it to AG for processing and scanning in August. I have not adjusted these images at all, except for resizing for the web.

They were scanned on my Epson V600 using their own software, which is clunky but functional enough, and works best, I think, when you switch off the helpful automatic adjustments it claims to be able to do. That said, these are not untouched, although I have tried to not fiddle about with the images in Capture One in the same way I might with a digital capture. Who cares about that? Every photographer in history without AI tools to help has adjusted highlights, shadow, contrast, mid-tone contrast, dodged, burned, cropped or rotated.

    "text": "Fuji X-T5\nLate 2022, Fuji brought out the fifth generation of the X-T series mirrorless cameras, the X-T5. I resisted, I really did. But:\n\n40.2 million pixels, 23.5mm x 15.7mm (APS-C) X-Trans CMOS sensor\n7-stop IBIS, ultrasonic sensor cleaning\nDigital Tele-Converter 2.0x / 1.4x\nSensitivity ISO125 - 12800\nNo anti-aliasing filter\nPixel Shift Multi Shot\n\nI bought the camera from the disinterested crew at Jessop’s on Sauchiehall Street in the weird Twixmas lull. Most other places had no stock, otherwise I would have rather got it from Wex, which is always a more pleasant experience. The first chance to use it came on our usual run for the hills on New Year’s Day, postponed a day this year due to a dinner date with friends on 1st. Weather sealing is built in to this generation of X-T cameras, which offers protection in the environments in which I often photograph. The weather obliged on this trip to Glencoe, ignoring the forecast of clear skies to offer some decent precipitation.\n We stopped on the way up, at a favourite beach on Loch Lubnaig to capture this view looking to the North. All of the images on this page were taken with the Fuji XF 16mm f/1.4 R WR lens. For depth of field, I stopped down to f/16 to keep the foreground grass reasonably sharp. At ISO400 this meant a shutter speed of 1/30s, something I would not have tried hand-held were it not for the in-built image stabilisation in this camera. I pushed my luck with that idea in the next photo of the waterfall.\n Cropped, hand-held at 1/15s, f/16 at ISO800. Focus is on the berries.\nI should have changed lens for this image but it was very icy and I was twitchy enough about falling. Gravity and I have a history when it comes to lenses, and so I didn’t want to risk dropping my new camera by fiddling about whilst concentrating on remaining vertical. Multitasking is a myth.\n Stitch of two images, ISO400, 1/60s hand held at f/14.\nI did consider the GF-X series, in particular the 100 mega pixel medium format GF-X 100S. The “100” indicates the 100 megapixel sensor built into that camera but that’s only one of the reasons you’d need a camera like that, the other being the “medium format” size of the sensor. I’ve been using the Fuji X system for almost 10 years now and have quite an investment in the glass. My wife is also a Fuji X photographer and the economy of a common lens system in the house makes sense. Carting about over six grand’s worth of camera on an icy day in Glencoe does not make sense, even if I could launch that much wonga at a hobby. I do this to reduce stress.\n 70 Mega pixel pano from four images, cropped and distortion adjusted in Capture One Pro 23. ISO400 1/125 s at f/13.\nThe above two panoramas were made using a favourite technique I use for landscapes, originally intended for large portraits, called the Brenizer method. Ryan Brenizer’s method aims for background blur, or bokeh and works well for that, but renders nice large, printable landscapes when used with a tight aperture. The X-T5 has this available, of course, and I am pleased with the two panoramas taken looking South and West from the Loch Tulla viewpoint on the A82 near Bridge of Orchy. The images here on the website are much reduced, of course, but you can get a sense of the scope by clicking one of them and scrolling.\n Buachaille Etive Mòr. Tripod, f/16, ISO125, 20 1/8s exposures, pixel-shifted\nThere’s a trick new to the X-T5, though, which is pixel shift, in which multiple images are taken and combined using special software into one large image file. The intention is to avoid having to interpolate colours, rendering more accurate colour in the final image. The bonus is that this process can yield much larger resolution in the final image. Other cameras have been able to do this for some time, but the X-T5 is the first in the series to have the capability. This image of Buachaille Etive Mòr used this feature to produce a 100 MPixel square crop. This image would make a 32 inch square print at 300 dpi, more than enough for anyone’s living room."

Agfa Agnar 1:4.5/85 Lens. Comes with original Flash.”\n\nI found, on opening the back, that it still had a roll of Kodacolor II in it from when it was last used. On having the film developed1, I estimate this to have been from around 1980. Here is one of the original images from that roll:\n Roses, 1980s?\nI finished the roll but clearly the film had suffered over time.\n Kinghorn, Fife, 2020\nThe camera itself is a second version Isolette I, produced between 1955 and 1958, according to camera-wiki.\n Isolette\nThe Isolette is a simple device: there is nothing electronic here, just a folding box with an f/4.5 Agnar 85mm fixed lens and Vario shutter. The film is advanced (if you remember2) by winding a knob on the top of the camera body, and the lens shutter is cocked separately (if you remember3). It does take a while to get used to, but the results are worth it – big, 6cm x 6cm frames that at a 4800 dpi scan will yield beautiful 100 mega pixel digital images that have all the character of the film stock.\n Yester Castle Keep, November 2020 Ilford Delta 3200, stand developed in Rodinal R09\nI got the light seals replaced by Cameratiks in Edinburgh for a fiver. This has given me a wonderful, portable medium format film camera that takes brilliant images for under £25.\n Yester Castle, November 2020 Ilford Delta 3200, stand developed in Rodinal R09\nThe shutter has three speeds: 1/25s, 1/50s and 1/200s, in addition to a bulb or B setting. The aperture runs from f/4.5 to f/32. Focusing distance is indicated in feet, with a separate ring indicating depth of field ranges for the selected aperture.\nI’m thankful to Camera Wiki and Roland and Caroline for their comprehensive information on this camera. Knowing more about the machine is of great technical benefit in operating it, but also brings me closer to it emotionally and aesthetically. There’s a nice review on 35mmc."

    "text": "Earlier in the year, we booked a dinner-bed-and-breakfast deal for Christmas Eve’s eve, as much for corporeal as spiritual health. Before he knew what was happening, the cat was dropped at his aunties’ place and we were in our favourite winter woodland. The intention was to unwind on the approach to Christmas Day; to hit pause on the processes of work, study, shopping and the rest. It worked a charm. We didn’t book the suite we had when we were married at the Dunkeld House Hotel but our room was enough for the purpose.\n The Hermitage Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4 lens.\nThere was plenty of time to enjoy a slow wander around the Hermitage before check-in. We took cameras, but not the usual paraphernalia of tripods and filters. Very soon, the life-giving oxygen of the trees respiring reached our lungs and Mother Nature cwtched us both. That feeling never gets old and before long we were on speaking terms with the residents again.\n\n Notices seem to have discouraged the previously trending habit of visitors forcing coins into any tree stump. Like most popular excesses, it’s neither healthy nor tasteful, like those repetitive memes you see. I’m glad the coin habit seems to be on the wane, even if the endless banality of social media is anything but. Oh, look, there’s yet another New Year’s resolution.\nThe soundscape on a walk around the Hermitage trail is varied, especially in the winter when the River Braan is swollen with meltwater from the recent snow. I didn’t record it: it’s white noise in a browser. Perhaps the picture will help you hear the rushing of the whitewater over rocks on the fall by Ossian’s Hall.\n\nOn the other side of the A9, the Tay wanders beside the hotel, altogether a more dignified spectacle than the its manic neighbour, the Braan. Alongside that river is the “dookit” or stone structure where we were married in the gentle Perthshire rainfall, with poetry and music and prayer. We walked down to remind ourselves and renew the feelings of that day. It was beautiful, of course.\n\nSo, now, I write this on the “other side” of the Christmas celebrations we were preparing ourselves for; the joys and excesses, catechisms and exchanges of gifts, avoided topics, revelations and ghosts of those departed. That one night away, to worship in the cathedral of nature, to enjoy someone else cooking, to be ourselves for ourselves, was not only the perfect preparation for the bacchanalian feast, but also a shahada for the year ahead.\n Nature’s Cathedral Fuji X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4 lens."

I’ve been making more large images recently, when using the digital kit, by stitching several images together, not unlike the Brenizer method.\n St. Monans beach steps For this image, taken as we returned from a walk along the path above the beach at St Monans, I used my old Nikon 85mm lens, stitching two images for a nice large square printable photo."

    "text": "On the day of the King’s proclamation, and in need of some sea air, we took a run up the coast to Lower Largo. It’s been a challenging week for us in one way and another, not least for the depth of emotion we felt at the death of the Queen. There have been other losses, of course, but this one seems to have brought home Joni Mitchell’s statement of the obvious: you don’t know what you’ve got ’til it’s gone.\n\nWe walked along the upper path, it being near high tide, to a favourite spot on the beach beside what looks like a rockery arrangement for a garden. The waters swirled around the rocks and the sun passed slowly, ever lower in the sky as autumn progresses, reminding us again of the relentless march of time. Not yet ready to forget the dog days of summer, the sun shone warmly.\n\nWe sat for a while, the tide shifting the shapes and scenery with sand and seaweed. Sea kayaks passed out in the Forth, with the dead offshore platform Sedco 711 breaking up the horizon. Sunlight sparkled and shimmered on the water as time, ralenti, became all but suspended in the reverie.\n\nThere’s nothing like a beach, and no better beach than a Scottish beach, to purge stress and anxiety, those corrosive curses of the contemporary condition. After the passage of some indeterminate time, things are just better than they were; big things smaller; a feeling of coming home settles.\n\nAs we walked along the path, the soothing splash of the waves on the shore below provided headspace in which to process and park our reflections on the week’s events and resolutions were quietly packed in their pockets, ready for when we will need them.\n Teasels\n\nI’ve learned that home isn’t a place, it’s a feeling. — Cecelia Ahern in Love, Rosie"

    "text": "On Saturday afternoon, for no good reason and many, we jumped in the car with some snacks and went hunting for fresh air and ice cream. We went for a stroll down at Loch Leven. Walking out on the jetty, we saw the light was perfect and a heron was posing nicely along the shore. Of course, by the time we walked back to the car for our cameras, he was gone. The ice cream was easy, Giacopazzi’s in Kinross providing a very nice solution. Cookies and Cream for him, Peach Melba for her.\n Loch Leven Fuji X-T2, 35mm f/2. Stitch of four images.\nOnwards to a partly aimless drive to explore some favourite roads: through Milnathort, out by Tillyrie and Athron Hill where we had a look at a housing development seriously out of our range. Who needs a house that big anyway?\n Stronachie Forest X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4\nOn an easy walk at Stronachie, all of our senses were exercised. The air was rich in oxygen from the forest, perfumed with heather; the air crackled as the broom seed pods burst open in the warm late summer sun.\n Broom seed pods\nI changed the lens on the Fuji for the Stronachie walk, having started with the compact and versatile Fuji 35mm f/2, for my Nikon 85mm f/1.4. This is a difficult lens to focus wide open but it makes quite creamy bokeh washes from the background colours, even in low light.\n Plenty of room in the forest f/1.4 at 1600 ISO\nThe Nikon lens is well known for its flare, too. This rainbow effect from shooting into the light is caused by internal flare in the lens.\n Rainbow flare\nThe Fuji X equivalent lens, the 90mm f/2, doesn’t have the same flare or bokeh as the much older Nikon. It’s not reasonable to compare them, perhaps, because of their age difference. Both are designed as portrait lenses.\n Stronachie Forest X-T2, Nikon 85mm f/1.4\nHow fortunate we are to live within reach of such wonders of nature."

There is a huge wall there which is home to various pigeons, and tells quite a story of how this place has changed over the years. Part of the cliff at the end of the harbour is no longer safe to walk along but it is easy to access the coastal walk through a short tunnel in the cliff at the end of the wall.\nDysart Harbour Wall\nA shed by the harbour was eclectically decorated with harboury stuff, and really set the feel of the place.\nWe arrived at feeding time for the boats, and they seemed to think we had treats for them.\nThe wall again, because it is fascinating. The landscape of it seemed other-worldly.\nPlenty of things to look at in a harbour. There were people working, moving boats, furling sails and so on, and just as many sitting on benches. There were benches everywhere we looked today and I think I like that. Perhaps we are becoming more reflective."

    "text": "This term has been quite a slog, and this week in particular has brought challenges both predictable and unexpected, and equally unwelcome. Very welcome, then, is a few days of retreat in one of our favourite places on this amazing planet of ours, by the Ardnamurchan peninsular.\n\n\nWe arrived uncharacteristically early and so stopped to stretch our legs and lungs before heading to our cottage on Loch Shiel. We saw the steam train on the way up, and what seemed like thirty thousand people at Glenfinnan desperate to watch it go over the viaduct. We passed by that opportunity to seek the road less travelled.\n Samalaman harbour X-T5, f/16 at 1/60s1\nWe found Samalaman Bay, with population but a population much more at leisure. Kayakers in the water, a family playing football on the beach, others reading and idly doing the crossword in the fresh air. We wandered on the shore making photographs, watching plovers and hooded crows, studying the urchins and just breathing.\n Samalaman harbour X-T5, f/16 at 1/60s2\nFurther up the road, we found a nice view back toward Glen Moidart, by three stone piles marked on the OS map as Captain Robertson’s Cairn. I pushed my luck with an image taken hand-held at 1/30s and either I am already quite chilled now, or that image stabilisation in the X-T5 is pretty good. Click the image for a closer look.\n Glen Moidart X-T5, f/16 at 1/30s3\n\n\n\nA close encounter with geese and an eagle on the shores of Loch Shiel, then a herd of deer scampering past the cottage, were precursors to a leisurely country breakfast. We headed out to explore Ardtoe and Kentra Bay with the dynamics of Scottish weather broad-brushing new scenery as we passed through the landscape. On the road, a folorn looking phone box stood mocking the advance of technology and the flatline mobile signal here, which is actually part of the attraction.\n It’s good to talk X-T5, f/11 at 1/30s4\nAlthough it wasn’t the weather to visit the singing sands (it apparently needs to be dry), we took a test drive to the car park at the start of the walking route that takes you there, at Arivegaig.\n The family X-T2, 1/125s, f/7.1, 400mm5\nOn the way down, we noted how rich the wildlife is here in comparison with other places we’ve been up and down the western highlands. After the eagle this morning, other birds had made their presence felt, as had the deer. The deer camouflage seems to make them confident and relaxed close to the fairly quiet roads. Sheep are confident, too, ambling along and disrespecting the passing places. They don’t need camouflage. They seem to think they are indestructible, like Edinburgh pedestrians. We eat a lot more lamb than we do venison, just saying.\n\n Kinlochmoidart pier X-T5, f/16 at 1/30s, ISO400\nI couldn’t resist this photogenic old pier on the road beside Loch Moidart’s glistening green sandbanks. We may return, having overheard in a restaurant this evening that it’s a good place for otters.\n\n\n\nBetween heavy rain showers, we took a walk to the local beach, as much to seek out more of the wildlife as to just stretch our legs. The river Shiel runs into the loch, with other inlets feeding the waters.\n Loch Shiel X-T5, f/8 at 1/500s, ISO200\nThe geese were occupying the pasture nearby, without being harrassed by the eagle today. This character quickly assumed alpha status and went through his best traffic cop routine. His pal seemed slighty embarrassed.\n No, that way X-T2, 1/1000s, f/5.6, 400mm6\nCastle Tioram on Loch Moidart was built over 800 years ago by Amie of the Clanranalds (Macdonald, 1889) after her husband, “Good John” of Isla had divorced her. It was torched by the clan chief Allan Macdonald during the Jacobite uprising in 1715 and has remained uninhabited since.\n Castle Tioram X-T5, f/16 at 1/30s, ISO125\nThe castle is reached by walking across the sand bar at Doirlinn. It is green on account of the damp and slippery approaches that kept the castle safe for so long from attackers.

We saw the steam train on the way up, and what seemed like thirty thousand people at Glenfinnan desperate to watch it go over the viaduct. We passed by that opportunity to seek the road less travelled.\n Samalaman harbour X-T5, f/16 at 1/60s1\nWe found Samalaman Bay, with population but a population much more at leisure. Kayakers in the water, a family playing football on the beach, others reading and idly doing the crossword in the fresh air. We wandered on the shore making photographs, watching plovers and hooded crows, studying the urchins and just breathing.\n Samalaman harbour X-T5, f/16 at 1/60s2\nFurther up the road, we found a nice view back toward Glen Moidart, by three stone piles marked on the OS map as Captain Robertson’s Cairn. I pushed my luck with an image taken hand-held at 1/30s and either I am already quite chilled now, or that image stabilisation in the X-T5 is pretty good.

    "text": "A close encounter with geese and an eagle on the shores of Loch Shiel, then a herd of deer scampering past the cottage, were precursors to a leisurely country breakfast. We headed out to explore Ardtoe and Kentra Bay with the dynamics of Scottish weather broad-brushing new scenery as we passed through the landscape. On the road, a folorn looking phone box stood mocking the advance of technology and the flatline mobile signal here, which is actually part of the attraction.\n It’s good to talk X-T5, f/11 at 1/30s4\nAlthough it wasn’t the weather to visit the singing sands (it apparently needs to be dry), we took a test drive to the car park at the start of the walking route that takes you there, at Arivegaig.\n The family X-T2, 1/125s, f/7.1, 400mm5\nOn the way down, we noted how rich the wildlife is here in comparison with other places we’ve been up and down the western highlands. After the eagle this morning, other birds had made their presence felt, as had the deer. The deer camouflage seems to make them confident and relaxed close to the fairly quiet roads. Sheep are confident, too, ambling along and disrespecting the passing places. They don’t need camouflage. They seem to think they are indestructible, like Edinburgh pedestrians. We eat a lot more lamb than we do venison, just saying.\n\n Kinlochmoidart pier X-T5, f/16 at 1/30s, ISO400\nI couldn’t resist this photogenic old pier on the road beside Loch Moidart’s glistening green sandbanks. We may return, having overheard in a restaurant this evening that it’s a good place for otters."

From the earliest cave paintings to the insta trophy, we record from imagination and experience the world around us. Photography is the ubiquitous manifestation of this in much of the contemporary world we inhabit, so much so that the art of capturing images might seem trivial. In these pages are some of my own images, with perhaps some thoughts or stories to go with them using my powerful ally, words. Here I have the advantage over the cave painter: I can express or explain context to help the observer make sense of the image on the screen.

    "text": "Remembering 9/11 20 years on\n Above Polney Loch, Ricoh GRIII\nWe needed an escape from the madness and so jumped in the car and headed North to Tiso, the M&S Foodstore and on to Dunkeld by way of the new road which is very nice, I have to say. The motive was almost a visceral need to be in the woods, and this time of year is when that experience is at its best as the colours are changing as fast as the air does: from the mouthfuls of balmy summer warmth to shorter bites of soupy vapour returned to the atmosphere as evanescent clouds. Mushroom time.\n Fungus abounds. f/8 1/2s\nI took a Hasselblad 503CW with a roll of Kodak Tri-X, and a Ricoh GRIII in my pocket for the more immediate gratification of having something to show on the day for our efforts. On this day, without explicitly talking about it, we remembered the events of 20 years ago with humility and gratitude, within one of Nature’s Cathedrals.\n Bark on various trees. f/2.8 1/2s\nIn the peace and reflection of our walk, I noticed the bark patterns on the aged trees, like the scars of experience, each different from the others, each with their own stories to tell. These patterns became as faces of old men and women, taciturn yet expressive of triumph and loss, of lessons learned and not, of survival and the remembrance of those who did not.\n Bark on various trees. f/2.8 1/4s\nThese were taken quite near the Cally car park where we began our stroll and I recall the steps, the birdsong and the additional aroma of the sawmill below the path, as I write this in October. A month from now is another great remembrance when I celebrate getting older, living vicariously for those who have been denied.\n Bark on various trees. f/2.8 1/30s\nThe leaves on the birch trees on the far bank were turning a light golden yellow, which in this black and white image, is reminiscent of infra-red photographs I have taken. Not in this case; just gorgeous tones against the evergreen backdrop.\n Polney Loch\nAt the end of the loch stands this wooden lodge – a fisherman’s howff, perhaps – that looks like it is from another age. It isn’t that old by the looks of it but we might easily be convinced that we stepped through a portal back there.\n House at the end of the Loch\nA detail of a hatch or door to the lodge reveals some old-time traditional craftsmanship, like you’d find on any great country estate. And ferns.\n Door detail\nI developed the film a couple of weeks later in Rodinal R09 using about 50:1 over 20 minutes with some agitation. I’m reasonably happy with the results but have to ask myself if the effort involved in getting these images out of an old Hasselblad is really that much superior to the almost instantaneous and high quality of the Ricoh. If it had been just the Ricoh that day, this whole story and reflection might have been consigned to history in a single, fleeting Instagram post. Perhaps it’s nothing to do with the camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\nCamera\nLens\nISO\nFormat\nAperture\nShutter\nComment\n\n\n\n\nHeader\nRicoh GR-III\nRicoh 18.3mm\nISO 6400\nDigital\nf/11\n1/25s\nAdjusted in Capture One.\n\n\nBark\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n400\n120\nf/2.8\n1/2 sec\n\n\n\nBark 2\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n400\n120\nf/2.8\n1/4 sec\n\n\n\nBark 3\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n400\n120\nf/2.8\n1/30 sec\n\n\n\nMushroom\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n400\n120\nf/2.8\n1/2 sec\n\n\n\nPolney Loch\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n400\n120\nf/22\n1/3 s\n\n\n\nHouse\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n400\n120\nf/18\n1 sec\n\n\n\nDoor\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n400\n120\nf/10\n1/8 s\n\n\n\nBelow\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n400\n120\nf/16\n1/4s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Polney Loch\n\n\n\nBrand\nType\nISO\nFormat\nExposures\nCamera\nLens\n\n\n\n\nKodak\nTri-X\n400\n120\n12\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n\n\n\nScanned 10 October 2021\n\n\n\nFrame\nImage\nAperture\nShutter\nComment\n\n\n\n\n1\nBark\nf/2.8\n1/2s\nCally car park\n\n\n2\nBark 2\nf/2.8\n1/4s\n\n\n\n3\nBark 3\nf/2.8\n1/30s\n\n\n\n4\nBark 4\nf/2.8\n1/125s\n\n\n\n5\nPolney Loch\nf/16\n1/4s\n\n\n\n6\nditto\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nHouse at the end of the Loch\nf/18\n1 sec\n\n\n\n8\nHouse 2\nf/22\n1/2 sec\n\n\n\n9\nDoor\nf/10\n1/8s\n\n\n\n10\nLoch\nf/22\n1/3s\n\n\n\n11\nMushrooms\nf/2.8\n1/2s\n\n\n\n12\nMushroom\nf/8\n1/2s"

    "text": "Early experience with Kodak’s vintage emulsion in a Nikon FM and an Agfa Isolette medium format folder.\n\nKodak Tri-X has been around since World War II and has earned a reputation for being flexible in all kinds of applications. I bought some 135 and 120 from Analog Wonderland for £7 and £8 per roll, respectively. The first roll went through my Hassleblad with not too much success and I promised then not to stand develop this film next time.\nWell, that’s all well and good but the exposures I made with both my Nikon FM and the Agfa Isolette were “empirical” and in variable light. Because of this, I semi-stand developed these in the hope that the development principle of this method might compensate for variable metering.\n Innerdownie Hill, Nikon FM. Compare with the similar image taken on my Hasselblad.\nThe first few frames of the roll taken in the Nikon FM were exposed up Innerdownie Hill. I had a No. 8 Yellow filter that ought to have about 2 stops of compensation applied to it, but I stupidly adjusted the ISO on the camera’s meter. Think about it – this camera has TTL or through-the lens metering. That means that the meter reads the light inside the camera after it has passed through the filter. It already compensates for the filter’s attenuation, so you don’t have to. This is one reason why semi-stand development was used for this film: I realised I had blundered on the metering.\n Glenquey reservoir\nI’ve learned not to take myself too seriously as a photographer. There are many, many better photographers than me, so I don’t get the rage when things don’t work out, except at myself when I continually fail to learn a lesson. Occasionally, though, I’ll try something I haven’t before, and the top image shows an attempt at “ICM”, or intentional camera movement. This has been used by some artists to convey emotion or a feeling, and I think my version has a sense of what it felt like to be in the woods on that snowy day. I’m pleased with it, anyway: it was consciously done, knowing that it was too dark for a hand-held capture, and that the mossy mound I had chosen for a makeshift tripod was just too mossy to be useful, it was a case of either not taking the photo, or pausing for a moment to connect to the feeling of it. I thought ICM might do it: I think it it did.\n by Glenquey sluice\nI scanned these after developing and then pulled them into Capture One for adjustment. Cropping and rotation are first, usually. Cropping, because the negative carrier Epson supplies with the scanner is pretty flimsy and difficult to use. Rotation is often required because I am rubbish at keeping a horizon level (ask anyone who flew with me in the days I had a pilot’s licence). Adjustment is necessary beyond this, because I didn’t let the scanner do anything by way of exposure adjustment or colour rendering – I am hoping that it just scans the negatives into a file containing all of the information in the film and doesn’t try to do any thinking for me.\n Loch Leven\nOther adjustments in Capture One include the standard set of looking at the levels and mid-tone contrast, and maybe removing dust specks (I’m not at the white cotton-glove stage of handling my negatives). Here is where I notice persistent problems: in the Nikon, I am noticing metering inconsistencies, or at least errors with extended use in cold weather. Perhaps I have relied heavily on the meter inside this camera too much, which has resulted in some disappointments, this roll included, when ambient light levels are low. If I’m going to have to work in digital post-processing, I might as well shoot digital in the first place.\n Loch Lurg\nSome time later, we were down at Pettycur beach for sunset, which came around the same time as high tide. The Isolette came out this time for a few frames, and the Nikon was on a tripod. The final outing to finish the film was back up a local hill for some exercise away from other people. Off the road, we saw nobody that wasn’t on some distant hill.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand\nType\nISO\nFormat\nExposures\nCamera\nLens\n\n\n\n\nKodak\nTri-X\n400\n35mm\n36\nNikon FM\nNikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8\n\n\nKodak\nTri-X\n400\n120\n12\nAgfa Isolette I\nAgfa Agnar 1:4.5/85"

    "text": "Sanna Bay, the small isles Fuji X-T2 XF16mm ISO800 f/16 at 1/125s\nWe took a trip to the Ardnamurchan peninsula for our anniversary and enjoyed the pleasures of that with some photography. The sun shone on the first day, and took a jigsaw puzzle day on the second, giving us time for proper rest and relaxation. We stayed at Ard Daraich, home of the artist Anna Raven and her husband, film-maker Norrie MacLaren. The house and gardens are well known as the former home of Constance Spry, famed as the creator of Coronation Chicken for the Queen. Our accommodation was the Garden Studio, former garage to the larger house and nestled between the house and Anna’s studio which houses a substantial printing press which she uses to create some of her work.\nOn this trip I finished a roll of Portra 160 in a Hasselblad 503CW and Kodak 400 Tri-X in the amazing little Agfa Isolette. The exposures in those two rolls are included further below.\n Bridge over the river Gour, Ricoh GRiii\nThe house sits on a lane that leads to Ardgour House, an altogether grander holiday destination, beyond our means and expectations. The lane passes over the river Gour by way of this bridge, which lit up in the unexpected sunshine of our first day, throwing reflections and patterns from the cool waters.\n Reflection 1, Fuji X-T2\n Reflection 2, Fuji X-T2\n Reflection 3, Fuji X-T2\n Reflection 4, Fuji X-T2\nIn the other direction, the lane ends at Loch Linnhe, which like all of Highland Scotland is alive with russets, rubies, rusty maroons, cardinals, carmines and ambers. The beach is striped with sea salad, echoing the leaves on the trees in heralding the fall of summer’s gaudy sparkle.\n Beach salad, Ricoh GR-III\nOur too-short sojourn at Ard Daraich was surely a rehearsal for a return to Ardgour and the stunning Ardnamurchan peninsula. A restful reconnaissance, well-earned and thoroughly appreciated as other duties call us back to the routine rumpus of that which pays us. We will be mellow, perhaps, as we savour the memories of the recent weekend.\n\n\n\nI feel I have to show you some comparatives, starting with this image. Compare it with the first image in this post.\n\n Beach salad, Hasselblad 503CW\nThis image is quite different from the russet reds of the digital capture I made at the same time: here, no adjustments were made after scanning other than a slight crop adjustment. I think it’s just as strong in rendering the emotion of the moment. You can almost smell it. This is my favourite image from the roll and one I might print.\n The Frandy Tree, Glendevon, Hasselblad 503CW\nThis is a famous tree to those who walk near Glendevon, as we did shortly after we got home. We know it as the Frandy Tree, named for the nearby fishery. It stands alone at the foot of Common Hill and strikes one of those poses that looks different at different times and seasons but also from different directions.\nYou can see some of the digital images captured on the trip are in the previous post, but I also carried my Agfa and will be posting images from that when I can.\n\n\n\nBrand\nType\nISO\nFormat\nExposures\nCamera\nLens\n\n\n\n\nKodak\nT-Max BW Pan\n400\n120\n12\nAgfa Isolette I\nAgfa Agnar 1:4.5/85\n\n\nKodak\nPortra\n160\n120\n12\nHasselblad 503CW\nZeiss 80mm F2.8 C\n\n\n\nThe Portra was sent to AG Labs 18 October 21 for C-41 processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrame\nImage\nAperture\nShutter\nComment\n\n\n\n\n1\nFrandy Tree\nf/16\n1/60s\n18 Sep 21\n\n\n2\n\nf/3.2\n1/500s\n\n\n\n3\n\nf/16\n1/500s\n\n\n\n4\nSheep\nf/10.6\n1/60s\n\n\n\n5\nSanna, Ardnamurchan Lighthouse\nf/13\n1/15s\n16 October\n\n\n6\nThe Small Isles\nf/16\n1/15s\n\n\n\n7\nArd Daraich loch\nf/18\n1/8s\n17 Oct\n\n\n8\nKara’s composition of 7\nf/22\n1/6s\n\n\n\n9 (header image)\nBeach salad\nf/8\n1/15s\n\n\n\n10\nJetty stakes\nf/22\n1/8s\n\n\n\n11\nGlen Coe in mist\nf/22\n1/4s\nLoch Tula 18 Oct\n\n\n12\nditto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis film was stand developed in Rodinal R09 in August 2022.\n\n\n\n\nFrame\nImage\nAperture\nShutter\nComment\n\n\n\n\n1\nFrandy Tree\nf/11\n1/125s\nGlendevon 25 September 21\n\n\n2\nDunning Road from Common Hill climb\nf/22\n1/50\n\n\n\n3\nFrandy Tree from CH summit\nf/22\n1/50\n\n\n\n4\nLower Glendevon Reservoir\nf/16\n1/50s\n\n\n\n5\nLochans on Common Hill\nf/4.5\n1/200s\n\n\n\n6\nWispy grass\nf/4.5\n1/200s\n\n\n\n7\nSmall isles\nf/22 1/50s\n16 Oct sanna\n\n\n\n8\nHouse on Sanna beach\nf/16\n1/50s\n\n\n\n9\nPhone box and coo\nf/8\n1/50s\n\n\n\n10\nJetty posts\nf/11\n1/50s\n17 Oct Ard Daraich\n\n\n11\nTwat, scrolled by\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nLoch and jetty posts\nf/16\n1/50s"

I can see what I was thinking with the line of the path central to the composition and am pleased that I kept these parallel to the lines of the church tower. There’s always a bit of difference between what you see in the rangefinder window and the image on the film so I consider this a successful image.\n Kilconquhar. Fuji GW690ii, Ektachrome E100\nI like the colours in this image taken at the loch, facing in the other direction, a few paces from where I captured the church. The complementary sky and grass tones here work for me. What is most impressive with this film stock is that there is almost no post processing required – the header sunset image taken in February at Pattiesmuir shows this, I think, as well as these snaps from Kilconquhar and St. Monans. Sunlight and good skies are a real bonus too.\n St. Monan’s harbour. Fuji GW690ii, Ektachrome E100\nTaken from the walk down to the famous wonky sea wall at St. Monans, this again might have been cropped on the left if it had been a digital capture. I love the two-weather sky here.\n\n\n\n Flowers at Dumbarnie Links, Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T\nCinestill 800T is a fast popular film stock, with the “T” indicating that it is designed to be used in tungsten light. It’s ideal for shooting urban scenes at night, which was my intention when I bought a few rolls of 135 and 120 at the beginning of 2021. This first roll was exposed in April in a Nikon FM in daylight at Seafield Beach, Dumbarnie Links (frames 16–25) and Elie (frames 26ff). Scanning as before, I processed them in Capture One, severely adjusting white balance and contrast to compensate for the blue shift of the abused film.\n Seafield Beach. Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T\nThis seemed to do the trick, rendering colours realistically with only two slider adjustments off the scanner. I’m learning to not allow the scanner to do anything with the colour of the files it creates. The above image of flowers at Dumbarnie Links illustrates this.\nI’m generally pleased with the results if not a little meh about my collection of dead boring images. Cinestill 800T is an exciting film to use for exciting images: punchy urban scenes evocative of some other era or dark filmic concepts. It’s not really meant for landscapes taken on walks, the purpose of which was not photography but clearing heads. I hope my next set of images with this film stock will do it better justice.\n Elie Beach. Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T\nI do like the rendering of contrast and tone in this film, once adjusted. Below, Lady’s Tower on a sunny day in Fife gives the film a chance to show this to create a nice image that evokes the feeling of the moment it was captured. More than that, I guess, can’t be asked for.\n Lady’s Tower, Elie. Nikon FM, Cinestill 800T\n\n\n\n St. Monans, Fife. Hasselblad 503CW, 80mm Zeiss.\nThis film stock was introduced in 2019 as a new film emulsion with extended range, meaning that the sensitivity is stated on the box as ISO 100 – 400 and you take your pick. I exposed this roll at the higher speed to see how it worked there. As with all of the films in this mini-series, I got AG Photographic to develop them for me.\n Bass Rock from Crail. Hasselblad 503CW, 80mm Zeiss.\nI first scanned this roll using 48-bit colour and 6400 dpi settings which produced square image files post-processing of about 180 megapixels. The colours are muted and cool. It took some time to find the correct white balance adjustment in Capture One but I think the image of St Monans church in Fife is a fair rendition of the film’s character. I like that the contrast is strong. You will not see the Hasselblad notches in that image because, as with many of my hand-held photographs, the horizon was a bit squint, as they say around here, so I had to adjust it and crop.\n Crail, Fife. Hasselblad 503CW, 80mm Zeiss.\nThis was the last useful frame off the roll, as some time later, during a visit to the Hermitage at Dunkeld, I reached for the Hasselblad and forgot there was film in it. Sheer stupidity caused me to open the film back to load a new film without first checking the clever mechanical indicator on the cartridge. I’m going to say that I will not do that again but then again I also say that my next car will be a Maserati.\n\n\n\n St.Monans Harbour. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS\nAs this is a black and white film, I might have developed this myself but as with all of the films in this mini-series, I got AG Photographic to develop it for me. It was scanned at 6400, then 3200 dpi in 24-bit colour (otherwise the scanner screws up the colour profile in the output file). In post-processing, the profile is switched to black and white. The early images were not of good enough resolution to justify 6400 dpi, hence the switch to something lower.\n Edinburgh, from Fife. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS\nMost of those early frames were quite disappointing, being underexposed and losing detail in the shadows. I’m fairly sure this was a metering issue: I rely on the built-in LED through-the-lens metering when shooting with the Nikon FM and this might be the price of laziness. Some can be recovered, though, and this image shows a sort of moody shoreline to illustrate the point.\n Edinburgh. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS\nThis is the view from my office window on the Holyrood campus. Delta 3200 might suggest a good low-light film but I think it’s more fast than it is good in the dark. It needs light to function properly. The next image also, perhaps, is more suited to the grainy emulsion of Delta 3200.\n The Palace, Rosyth. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS\nSomething more urban in flavour demands not only monochrome but also the character of a grainy film stock like this. I don’t think it handles wide dynamic range the way I had hoped, however. Shooting into the light is probably not the best idea:\n Harbour Bell, St.Monans. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS\nDelta 3200 can perform well with good light, and yield decent contrasty images if you meter and expose correctly.\n\n\n\n Queensferry Crossing from St. Margaret’s Marsh\nI scanned most of these at 3200 or 4800 dpi in 48-bit colour with the scanner’s colour handling switch off. The first few frames were taken at the Hermitage, near Dunkeld, during a weekend run up to one of our favourite places in May. We needed reflection time and the COVID restrictions were just so that we could do the right thing as we did The Right Thing for us.\n Ossian’s Hall. Nikon FM, 28mm f/1.4 AiS\nThe Dunkeld weekend was not in the brightest of sunshine and that tends to wash out the colours in Portra, I think. This is a dark and moody kind of place when it’s overcast, so the image above does portray that. No marks for composition – there’s a better portrait version but that favours the bridge over the hall and I wanted to show that in this post.\n Queensferry Crossing from St. Margaret’s Marsh\nThere was better light when we walked on the Forth Shore at St. Margaret’s Marsh, between the bridges and the dockyard. Some while later, we were at Loch Lubnaig where the colours of the greenery dominate the images taken with this film.\n\nI’m not such a fan of 160 in anything other than really good daylight. Composition plays a part, too, and these images aren’t my best: the last few frames of the roll were taken at Burntisland."

    "text": "Holiday how the Scots do it\n Achmelvich beach, X-T2 XF35mm, ISO 1600 f/2 at 1/1000s\nEmerging confidently from weeks of COVID-19 lockdown and the sting of a cancelled Hebridean trip at Easter, we consoled ourselves with a few days immersed in the beauty of the Sutherland Assynt.\nI went armed with a full complement of cameras (five - count them. Who needs five cameras?), most of which I now fit into a new kitBrick which I picked up at Tiso in Perth on the way up. Finally, I have a camera kit bag solution that works for all the gear I carry on a trip like this.\n\n\nThe drive was long but pleasant, in a new (to us) Mercedes GLA, which is much more suited to the kind of driving one does on a trip to the Northwest of Scotland than the saloon it replaced. We took a look at Achmelvich beach after settling in to the apartment we had AirBnB’d for a few nights. Everything seems booked up, which seems weird, given that there are almost no overseas visitors to these shores at present and the roads are almost utterly empty.\n Achmelvich beach X-T2 XF35mm, ISO 1600 f/2 at 1/1000s\nWe returned to Achmelvich a couple of times, well, because we love it, even if the weather doesn’t always love us. The machair is in full bloom at the moment. The local people care for it by mowing swards through the meadow-like grass to encourage visitors not to trample randomly over the new growth. There are visitors here apart from ourselves: I edited out the tent on the beach in the next photo, because camping isn’t allowed on the beach at Achmelvich.\n Achmevlich beach (long exposure) X-T2 XF16mm, ISO 200 f/16 at 20 s\n Achmevlich beach (Panchro 400). The figure in the grass is Kara. Fuji GW690ii f/11 at 1/30s. Toning in Capture One. You can read more about this roll and how I developed it here.\n\n\n\nWe took the walking route around Stac Pollaidh. There’s a new, lottery-funded, improved path here to protect the slopes and give the old well-trodden path a chance to recover.\n\nGoing up Stac Pollaidh, looking East X-T2 XF16mm, ISO 200 f/11 at 1/250s. Stitch of 3 images (Hugin)\n Going up Stac Pollaidh, looking South back towards the car park iPhone 11 wide-angle\nAlthough we hadn’t really intended to, we took the higher path, and reached the ridge near the top, which in retrospect, is something we feel good about. Going the last few metres higher required better climbing experience, gear, or stupidity. Fortunately, we had left ours at the fork in the lower path.\n On the ridge on Stac Pollaidh Ricoh GRIII, taken by Kara\n\n\n\nOn a long meandering drive around the Coigach peninsula, the light changed constantly. Waze told us we were 2 hours from our apartment as we turned for home, yet only 37 km distant. This is because, perhaps, the twisty single-track roads ought to be driven only at 20 kph. The streams and foliage, deer and passing places pass by the window even at that speed, every now and then opening up wide open skies, the cotton grass stretching to the distant hills.\n Road to Achnahaird Bay X-T2 XF16mm, ISO 320 f/16 at 1/125s. Stitch of 3 images (Hugin), cropped and coloured in Capture One Pro 20\n… and the ever-present sheep.\n Two wanderers iPhone 11 wide-angle\n\n\n\nThis holiday was a good way to get familiar with a new car and I felt comfortable enough after a day or so to take it off-road down to a fisheries bothy at Stoer. We got chatting to a ranger when were here last October about whales and dolphins. We had promised to send the Mercedes dealer a picture of the car from our trip.\n The new Merc looking moody at Stoer Ricoh GRIII, Silver Efex Pro 2.0\nOne of our favourite places (of all the favourite places we have around this part of Scotland) is Clachtoll beach, which at the time we visited, was at high tide.\n Clachtoll beach Ricoh GRIII, Capture One colour adjustments\n\n\n\nThe final day of our holiday was spent much further South, in Glencoe, stopping on the way down to make a brew and eat BLT sandwiches and cheese1 on the gravelly beach at Loch Lochy. Even with a wind, that was paradise.\n Loch Lochy iPhone 11 wide-angle\nWe checked in to The Corran by the ferry terminal and headed straight out for a walk along the Coupall to catch some time with Buachaille Etive Mòr.\n Buachaille Etive Mòr X-T2 XF16mm, ISO 200 f/16 at 0.4 s\nThis is a magical place, even in the rain. Actually, probably especially in the rain. The heather and harebells, dancing in the wind to the syncopation of the river rushing over the rocks, flail and flutter, the great herdsman above, indifferent to their earnest performance.\n Harebells at Etive Mòr Ricoh GRIII, ISO 400 f/16 at 1/40s\nThe day’s adventure concluded with a flaccid fish supper from the Quarrier’s Kitchen in Ballachulish, before heading back to Corran to journal the day.\n\n\n\nThe drive home was wet but not without adventure as we stopped at Tindrum, more to support the business than to buy stuff we actually needed. We marvelled at how busy it was, and how heavy the Northbound traffic was, caravans and campers heading in droves for the NC500 and the midges.\nWe stopped briefly at Achnambeithatch, the little white cottage below Bidean nam Bian on the A82, to watch the weather for a while.\n Achnambeithatch Ricoh GRIII, ISO 400 f/16 at 1/60 s\nWe decided that the rain was in for the day, so headed South, and lunched at the King’s House, as much to their delight as ours, emerging as they were for the first day back in business after months of COVID-19 closure.\n\n\n\nThere are more images associated with this post, taken with the Nikon FM using Ilford Orthochromatic film. I am a bit disappointed with the film photos on this trip. I hoped for better, sharper, images but am just not getting that with the big Fuji GW690ii at the moment. I am making errors, losing an entire roll from an earlier trip by using stop bath instead of developer, and the Lomo Berlin film I had in the GW690iii on this trip, which I ruined by using the wrong developer. You live and learn."

    "text": "A beach walk for exercise, officer, with an old Agfa.\n Frame 8 Inside the Monk’s cave\nThis is the first roll of my own film I have put through this little Agfa Isolette (see what I did there?). My wife and I went out during the so-called lockdown for some messages and a little exercise, having heard on the news that it’s OK to get in your car and take a short drive to somewhere local if it helps you remain socially distanced enough to fight the spread of COVID-19. We decided that a walk on a beach would be safer and more responsible than a walk in the local park.\n\n\nI’m still not quite myself following a recent loss, but I make no excuses for myself: the first four exposures on this film in the camera were all carefully exposed without remembering to advance the film. I re-took the building (Charles Hill Battery) on frame 2 using the same settings.\n Frame 2 Building\nI double-exposed again on frame 4, re-taking the shots in 5 and 6. Apparently, photography is good for mindfulness. One of the scans, of the Monk’s Cave, where monks used to wait for the boat to take them to Inchcolm Island out in the Forth, I processed using the Nik Collection Silver Efex Pro 2 application to bring out the detail in the sky and foreground. I quite like it:\n Frame 6. The Monk’s cave, post processed in Silver Efex (Nik Collection)\n\n\n\nI like this film, known as TMY, because it’s reliably good and very tolerant of my handling. This roll I processed myself, using 50:1 Rodinal R09 for 18 minutes and Kodak Fixer/Hardener. I had the devil of a job getting the film on the Paterson Reel and got quite grumpy at myself. The development went OK once I’d sorted out my fingers and thumbs. I scanned a selection of the frames on my Epson using their dreadful Silverfast 8 software and noticed that pretty much every one had a band across the top, presumably from a light leak in the camera somewhere. You can see it in the building image above, and faintly in the tree image:\n Frame 12. Dead tree\nI really don’t think I am going to worry about it - this camera cost me less than twenty quid including postage so a professional CLA1 is not economically viable. Quite probably the light seals along the bottom of the camera are just needing replaced, a job I might do in a future lock-down.\nThe scanned tiff files were converted in Capture One, with a bit of contrast adjustment and cropping in the header image.\n\n\n\nI notice that I didn’t deviate from 1/200s shutter speed with this roll. It was quite bright and so perhaps 400 ISO wasn’t right for the conditions, given that this camera’s shutter doesn’t go any faster than that. Even inside the Monk’s cave (above), I was exposing for the surfaces lit directly from the outside.\n Frame 5, Inchcolm Island, cropped\n\n\n\nAll images on this page taken with an Agfa Isolette I fitted with the Agfa Agnar 1:4.5/85 lens.

    "text": "The castle wall, Ilford Delta 3200\nWe went down to Gifford, in East Lothian, to find that the new owners of the farm have made walkers on the land very unwelcome. I wasn’t in the mood for a fight, so we took a drive down to the golf club, where we were welcome to park, provided that we let them know in the clubhouse. It’s nice to know there are still public-spirited folk out there.\nI decided not to be burdened with camera gear, so just took my little Afga Isolette, which had a few frames left in it of a roll of Fuji Pro400H, and a roll of Ilford Delta 3200 in my pocket.\n Part of the keep remains, Ilford Delta 3200\nA walk alongside the bunkers and greensward took us to one of our favourite haunts, Goblin Ha’. This magical place has been here for almost a thousand years and is full of stories and little hidey-places. The remains of the castle and keep are here, along with a subterranean crypt that can be accessed with care: the path is slippery and dangerous at the best of times, let alone in the wet seasons.\n The underground crypt from outside, Ilford Delta 3200\nThe Fuji 400H came back from AG Labs absolutely flat, which makes it easier to scan. I’d struggled recently with film stock curling in the scanner, spoiling my efforts to make nice, in-focus images. The images themselves were more contrasty and emotive in the Ilford photographs, in my view. Compare the above image with this one:\n The crypt from outside, Fujifilm Pro 400H\nThis was a family outing: a chance for some of us to spend quality time together in this natural and mystical place, right for reflection. The setting was good for clearing heads and strengthening bonds. Little discoveries and the distraction of mindful photography made for a perfect autumnal break from the madness.\n A portal in the old castle wall, Ilford Delta 3200\nI developed the Delta 3200 film in 1:150 Rodinal R09 for an hour and scanned both on my Epson V600 at 4800 dpi. Most of the images are about 100 Mega pixels at that resolution and the negatives are nice and sharp.

    "text": "How I got on with an old film found in a cheap camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake visible, what without you, might perhaps never have been seen.\n– Robert Bresson\n\n\n\n\nKinghorn, 2020 f/22 at 1/200s\nIn a recent post, I mentioned that I had bought a new-to-me Agfa Isolette I camera. In it, I discovered as I opened the back, was an old roll of Kodacolor II. I closed the back and rolled it on to the next frame. A couple of days later, when my wife and I went to the beach for some relief from the emerging COVID-19 situation, I took the camera along.\n\n\nOn the beach, having not really thought about it properly, I decided to finish the film off. The Isolette doesn’t have a meter, and I’d forgotten my Gossen, so I figured I’d give the “Sunny 16” rule a try. This goes something like: “if it’s sunny, and you’re shooting at f/16, then the shutter speed is the inverse of the film speed.” I later discovered that this fim had a speed rating of 100 ASA, but at the time I guessed that it might be a 400, so went for a shutter speed of 1/200th of a second at f/22. This blunder might have been mitigated against by the well-known heuristic or rule-of-thumb for expired films stock, which suggests that you should treat the film as being slower by 1 stop for every decade it is out of date. So, I should have rated the original 100 ASA film at 25. If all of those estimates and rules were correct, I was effectively underexposing on the beach by about 4 stops. They weren’t.\n\n\n\nThe film was turned round by the brilliant AG Photolab in double-quick time, and I got to the scanner to have a look at these images. I wasn’t expecting stellar quality images and wasn’t disappointed. I pulled the scans into Capture One to see if I could do anything but in the end, I just cropped and exported them.\n\n\n\nThe recent exposures at Kinghorn show quite a lot of fogging and what looks to me like a fungal film over the whole frame. There is evidence of light leaking into the frame at the top and bottom. I can’t explain this because the back of the camera hinges open - the central frames I inadvertently exposed when I opened the camera when I first unpacked it are as you’d expect. The red fog at the edges appears across the whole film. This is one of the frames exposed last week:\n Kinghorn beach Isolette I, f/22 at 1/200s. Recent exposure.\n\n\n\nThe exposures from the beginning of the film were perhaps made when it was put into the back of the cupboard, or wherever, back in the 1980s when this little Isolette was last used before finding itself washed up on eBay. I have no idea where they were taken but the houses look familiar, as if in a garden city like Letchworth or Rosyth.

    "text": "Sunday 8th March, 2020.  Rainbow over Earlsferry iPhone\nWe love a road trip and had been promising ourselves a little get-away day for the past couple of weeks. Having worked together all morning to tidy the house, we finally sorted the camera gear and jumped in the car to head up the coast of Fife towards the East Neuk and the little town of Earlsferry.\n\n\nWe went to the shore at the Western edge of the town to exercise ourselves and our gear. Kara was keen to get some long exposures and I went looking for contrast as I had both the Fuji GW and Nikon FM loaded with black and white film1. This is Bass Rock, taken with the Fuji:\n Bass Rock through wall Fuji GW690ii, Ilford Pan F Plus 50 f/22 at 1/15s\nThe same view, in Delta 400, taken with the Nikon FM and post-processed in Capture One Pro:\n Bass Rock Nikon FM AI-s 28mm f/2.8, Delta 400 f/22 at 1/125s. Yellow filter.\nThe difference between the above two images goes beyond what you see, which is as much down to what I did with the image after it was developed as it is the difference in the two cameras. The Fuji is a medium format camera and produces negatives which are 6cm by 9cm in size: six times larger than those produced in the 35mm Nikon FM. This only really makes a difference if you want to make very large prints from the negatives, when the limitations of the photographer are as significant as anything else. This, I think, will torment me for the next few years as I develop and learn. What this big Fuji isn’t going to do, I am learning, is give me 350 mega-pixel images in super-sharp crispy detail, not at least until I learn how to manage and operate the equipment better.\nThe Nikon made some more good images of the wonderful coastline here. I was using a Tiffen yellow filter to give contrast and texture in the sky at the same time as sustaining details in the shadows.\n The Forth Nikon FM AI-s 28mm f/2.8, Delta 400 f/16 at 1/125s. Yellow filter.\n\n\n\nSt Monans is famous for its zig-zag breakwater but is also where Kara’s family have deep fishing roots. We drove around the town and enjoyed a brilliant sky as the weather pushed and tugged at the air over the Forth Estuary, making rainshafts, cloud patterns, whooping, whacking waves on the rocks and double bows over the Eastern landscape. Food lust overcame us, so we headed for the world-famous Anstruther chippie and enjoyed proper fish and chips in the car as it got dark."

We took ourselves off to Belhaven beach for such a walk, to clear the head, and to reset our fish supper metrics after a bad experience at Ballachulish.\nI’m finding myself using a mix of digital and film cameras when I’m out. When I need to shoot quickly, it’s more likely that I’ll grab the Ricoh in my pocket, like when I noticed a figure walking across the scene before us:\n Socially distant Ricoh GRIII, cropped and desaturated\nI keep the Ricoh in aperture-priority mode at f/16 when shooting landscape, if the light is OK.

    "text": "On a weekend break in Perthshire, I tried my hand at infra-red by dropping a roll of Ilford SFX 200 film in my Fuji GW690ii “Texas Leica” rangefinder camera. My wife and I were in Dunkeld celebrating our first anniversary, returning to where we were married. This year, autumn was on time and the Hermitage forest was just magnificent and we had time to enjoy it properly.\nI’ve never used infra-red sensitive film before so I did a bit of reading about it before the trip: on the day, I put a Neewer IR720 filter on and took about 6 stops off the exposure estimates. I metered at ISO 200, which is the box speed for this film in visible light.\n The Hermitage forest\nThe exposures looked a couple of stops under when I got the film back from AG Labs, but there was plenty of detail available in the negatives to lift out. I had intended to develop the film at home but life’s a bit busy at the moment for such pleasures. I scanned the film on an Epson V600 and made adjustments in Capture One Pro.\n The river Braan above the Tay\nI have ditched my neurotic habit of writing down every exposure setting for every frame. Consequently, I’ve enjoyed my photography more, although I am less certain of good results. One benefit of living in the modern age is that we have tools to make adjustments after scanning to yield something not unpleasing.\n At the Hermitage, looking towards the bridge.\nThe image at the top of the page is of the waterfall by Ossian’s Hall, which can just bee seen at the right of the frame. I cropped this down but kept the others on this page at the full size.\n Hermitage forest trails. Long exposures revealed in the movement.\nI’m quite pleased with the results from my first time out with near-infra-red film. There’s a slightly timeless look to the pictures caused by the rendering of foliage in infra-red wavelengths. Next time, maybe I’ll seek brighter light and try longer exposures using the 850nm or 950nm filter.\n\n\nInfra red sensitive black and white film, cost £12.50 per roll from Analog Wonderland.

Needless to say, I’ve had some results I am very pleased with, and a whole series of disappointments and frustrations with myself on the way.\n\n\nMy monster medium-format Fuji GW690ii (above, centre) is a rangefinder on steroids, one of a series of cameras known as the “Texas Leicas” on account of their size. They were made for Japanese bus tour customers, who got a souvenir snap of the group as they visited Mt. Fuji, or Kyoto, which was developed and printed in time for the end of the trip. The huge 6cm x 9cm negatives it produces are large enough to render detail from the fixed 90mm lens even when enlarged and printed for the office wall. I bought a “near mint” one from ODA-Japan at the end of 2019 for over £500 including taxes and fees. From the listing:\n\nGrade: Near Mint - Pre-owned, minimal signs of use. Appearance is very beautiful, tiny scuffs from normal use. It shows signs of use. *Please check photos. New Light Seals!! Optics: Beautiful condition.\n\nNone of those words, I have learned, describe the camera. I had been disappointed with some of the photos taken with it. This, for example, taken on Kinghorn Beach, I hoped would be much clearer:\n Parasurfers, Kinghorn Beach Fuji GW690ii, Ilford Pan F Plus 50, f/11 at 1/60s\nSometimes sharpness doesn’t matter too much. This image, taken on a trip to the Faroes before the COVID lockdown, still looks pretty nice to me, not least because the Portra film I was using is just wonderful if you catch the light right:\n Huts near Vágar Airport Fuji GW690ii, Kodak Portra 160, f/11 at 1/60s\n\n\n\nMy old Nikon FM, which went everywhere I did as I travelled with the military and then work from 1977 to the turn of the century, had been condemned by Lehmans as being beyond repair, specifically, the shutter mechanism, for which no spares are available. Its “FULLY TESTED EXCELLENT” replacement I had bought from SE Cameras (eBay) has never been right, showing light leaks and odd exposure variations. Here’s an example:\n Parasurfers at Kinghorn, Nikon FM, Nikon AI-s 28mm f/2.8, Ilford Delta 400, f/16 at 1/125s. Yellow filter.\nThe light leaks were particularly bad in a recent film - 20 of the 36 exposures were spoiled - and this is what triggered me to finally take action and get professional help.\n\n\n\nPractice makes perfect, they say, and they also say that a bad workman blames his tools. That said, I bet even Chippendale launched more than one of his chisels across the workshop on his learning journey. Ergo, I decided recently to get these cameras “CLA”-ed, or clean, lubricate, and adjust-ed. \nI took the two Nikons and the Fuji to a little repair shop in Morningside, Edinburgh and asked, if possible, for them to make one good camera out of the two Nikons, and fix any focusing problems there might be in the Fuji. All I really wanted to know is whether the criticism I have had of recent photographs is all down to poor technique, or whether it might - just might - be something to do with the camera.\nI picked up the three cameras today, all in excellent working order, with a clear list of things that had been done to them and an assurance (and a reasonable limited warranty) that they are “to specification”. Can’t wait to get out with some film in them.\n\n\n\n\nDon’t buy from eBay and expect things to be as described\nGet cameras that are new to you, checked and serviced\nGet your CLA done by a reputable, local repair shop\n\n\n\n\nI buy (too much) film from Analogue Wonderland, and get it developed at AG Photolab, who have been brilliant in helping me make sense of some of the recent exposure problems.\nCameratiks in Edinburgh is staffed by calm, competent and polite people who know what they are doing. They are not cheap, nor are they expensive: you can buy quality digital and film gear there, and have them offer decent advice on the basis that you will go back there next time you need anything. That’s my kind of business."

    "text": "My monster medium-format Fuji GW690ii (above, centre) is a rangefinder on steroids, one of a series of cameras known as the “Texas Leicas” on account of their size. They were made for Japanese bus tour customers, who got a souvenir snap of the group as they visited Mt. Fuji, or Kyoto, which was developed and printed in time for the end of the trip. The huge 6cm x 9cm negatives it produces are large enough to render detail from the fixed 90mm lens even when enlarged and printed for the office wall.
